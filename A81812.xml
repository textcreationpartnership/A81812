            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt his Perſonall perfections: ſecondly, his continuall ſupport of the ſame: thirdly, an oneneſſe or ſelfeneſſe with the parts of the whole creation: fourthly, the perfections of the whole creation, led his reaſonable ſoule in love by his ſenſes to a perfect union with God: Of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his Perſonall Perfections are deſcribed by <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 2 7 in three particulars; firſt, the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the earth; and that was the perfection of his body: ſecondly, he breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and that was his ſoules creation by infuſion: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, man became a living ſoule that is compleatly compoſed in his Vegetative, Senſitive, and Rationalls: or in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall perfections, rightly diſpoſed to operate according to that eſtate; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> might truly ſay to God of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in him, I will praiſe thee, for I am fearefully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy workes, and that my ſoule knowes right well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>verſe</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly God rendered to him by the whole perfections of the creation, a continued ſupportation of his Perſonall perfections, and therefore hee made all firſt, and man laſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. implying man could not ſubſiſt one minute<note n="*" place="margin">It is true, man now ſubſiſts, but not perfect in nature; but as the creation is ſubject to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man.</note> in his Perſonall perfection out of it; Therefore as the ſpangled skie with Lamps of light in their order, was of his Houſe but the ſeiled roofe: ſo alſo the earth with it's moſt perfect fragrancie and ornaments, was but the pavement of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
               <p>And as the creatures vegetable being his appointed food, rendering their ſpirit or life to his nutrimentall ſupport, ſo alſo the virtuall force of the celeſtiall and terreſtriall globe, in a mutuall efflux, did not onely with their moſt ſweet imbreathings, internally maintain that compound of <hi>Adams</hi> ſweet an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, an oneneſſe or ſelfeneſſe with the parts of the whole Creation; It is true, Earth, Ayre, Water and Fire, were not the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet every one of their natures was in his, as the principles of his Elementary body, and ſo were to him as himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Againe, the nature and lives of vegetable Plants and Trees, was not the nature of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet their kind of natures and lives were reſident in his: as in the growth of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtature the nayles of his fingers, toes, and other parts, as parts of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Againe, the nature and lives of ſenſitive Creatures were not the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the Beaſts and Birds and other of that generall nature; yet their kinds of nature was in his: as in his touch, taſte, hearing, ſmelling and ſeeing, as parts of himſelfe; but the womans nature was his, and his hers; as fleſh of his fleſh, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And from this univerſall oneneſſe or ſelfeneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did naturally<note n="*" place="margin">The firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table of the morall law.</note> ſpring in the mind of <hi>Adam</hi> in his pure Naturalls, the ſecond Table of the morall Law, namely, <hi>To love thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Eſſence of <hi>Adams</hi> reaſonable ſoule, although he knew it farre more then we doe ours, yet he knew it not but by it's effects: So alſo, the intrinſecall formes of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, although hee knew them by their effects more then we can, and in that reſpect ſaw a kinde of ſelfeneſſe of the ſoules of all creatures with himſelfe farre more then wee can; yet in reſpect of their ſpecificating forme, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally gave this thing to be this, and that to be that.</p>
               <p>This to him was inviſible: as was his owne reaſonable ſoule, which was his intrinſecall forme primarily ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him from other creatures.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why the internall forme or ſoule, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all creatures even to the being of a ſtone is inviſible, is this, becauſe mans reaſonable ſoule being involved in an Elementary body, although perfect, is clouded to perceive his owne nature, or the like: For as Gods eſſentiall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by reaſon of his unmeaſurable perfections, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved farre from ſenſe and weake reaſon; and therefore unperceiveable and inviſible to man; ſo alſo is the manner knowne onely to God, how all things ſubſiſt in him, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156664:10"/> receive the continuation of their ſubtile lives and beings individually.</p>
               <p>And the univerſall ground of this ſelfeneſſe betweene all creatures and <hi>Adam</hi> in the creation, is this; becauſe the whole creation conſiſting of many parts, was but one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or off-ſpring of God, as his Generation; yet not by any derivation of his Eſſence eſſentially, but by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full production by creation wondrouſly.</p>
               <p>As firſt, from a meere nothing to a formleſſe maſſe, and from thence to that perfection which then it was, and ſo now all things ſubſiſt and continue in him, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, is inviſible and unperceiveable to man; if to <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, much more now to all mankinde, but we muſt believe it, becauſe God hath ſaid it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>verſ</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the perfections of the whole creation, led <hi>Adams</hi> reaſonable ſoule, by his ſenſes, to a perfect union of love in God, which was his moſt proper bleſſedneſſe in the ſtate of creation: for although the ſoules infuſion was the beſt o his being; yet it was no part of his bleſſedneſſe, for that was but the uniting of two created natures to make his perſonall being, which a man may have, and be accurſed.</p>
               <p>But this was the union of the creature with the Creator, by perfect love in a mutuall concordance; for as God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Adam</hi> fitly and rightly diſpoſed to operate to God as his chiefeſt good, ſo alſo God did excitively draw him to this union by leading him, from the effect to the cauſe, from the creation to the Creator as from the drop to the Ocean.</p>
               <p>For God to <hi>Adam</hi> was not onely tranſparently agreeable (by the perfection of the creation) to his ſenſes, but alſo to his underſtanding and his will: firſt to his underſtanding, by the truth of that perfection; and ſecondly to his will in the perfection of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>For, firſt to his underſtanding, by all his ſenſes was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the truth of Gods power and wiſdome, in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull compoſure of all creatures, in their ſeverall ſhapes, natures, kindes, qualities and vertues, harmoniouſly amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but chiefly <hi>Adams</hi> perſonall perfections ſo beautifull, and his reaſonable ſoule, the mirror of Gods worke of power and wiſedome; and all joyntly together gave <hi>Adam</hi> a concludent proofe, that God in himſelfe was infinitely beyond all this that he had communicated to the perfection of the creation, and therefore this demonſtrative Principle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156664:10"/> of truth was agreeable to the naturall property of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which naturally lookes at truths.</p>
               <p>Secondly, alſo to his will was an agreeableneſſe in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Firſt in reſpect of the things themſelves; all good, yea very good by Gods owne teſtimony: Secondly to <hi>Adam</hi> as an Ocean of good univerſally terminating all their forces and vertues of their perfections to his harmoniſing ſupport, as before is declared.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe being both in nature and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all creatures, as their Lord and King, (under God) ſo that by his ſenſes, to his underſtanding and will, was declared the good will of God to him in all, by all and above all creatures.</p>
               <p>Therefore here was an agreeableneſſe, univerſally to his will, which naturally look'd at God as the eye doth follow the light; So that if <hi>Adam</hi> was created in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him (as certainly hee was) then mans originall righteouſneſſe in his pure naturals was this, namely,<note place="margin">Col. 3.10. Eph. 4.24.</note> man<note n="*" place="margin">Mans original righteouſneſſe.</note> operating underſtandingly from the effect to the cauſe, from the whole creation to the Creator, according to the rules of the perfections of the creation, as to him in whom he and they did live, move, and had their being.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why thus to operate, was his naturall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, is, becauſe it was right according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that truth which ſhined in the perfections of the creatures to him.</p>
               <p>Againe, his holineſſe in his pure naturalls was this: his operating according to the perfections of the creatures in the<note place="margin">Mans originall holineſſe.</note> purity of his perfect love to God, in all, through all, and above all, living not ſo much amongſt the perfection of the creatures, where he was as in God whom he ſo loved, and the reaſon why, in theſe perfections of love was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined his naturall holineſſe, was this: Becauſe by it hee did not onely ſet God above all creatures, but alſo by it hee did rightly dedicate himſelfe to Gods uſe onely, and alone with al his ſoule, with al his heart, and with all his ſtrength; for it is the property of love to adde to the perfection of the thing loved, more then to it ſelfe, as wee ſee in <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> had this in the perfection of it, is proved thus; if all love in men generally doth ariſe from that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156664:11"/> which is betweene the ſubject and the object; as certainly it doth, then in <hi>Adam</hi> moſt of all, becauſe to him (the Subject) God (the Object) did ſhine in all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the creation in a ſutable agreeableneſſe, in all things in all reſpects, as before is proved.</p>
               <p>Therefore in <hi>Adam</hi> there was the truth of that perfect love to God againe; and not onely the truth but the uttermoſt extent of love in the ſtrength thereof: for if the beauty of the Object being tranſparant to the Subject, will draw forth all the ſtrength, which is in the Subject to it ſelfe, as in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And from this Principle in his minde did naturally<note n="*" place="margin">The firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the firſt Table of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, that man in his innocency, in the perfections of his righteouſneſſe and holineſſe was but the receiver of all his good; as his being paſſively by creation; and his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe actively by reception, as by his ſenſe, his reaſon, will and affections, he enjoyed God.</p>
               <p>And what had hee that hee had not received? for it is proper to God alone to be being and bleſſedneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and of himſelfe; Therefore both men and Angels are but receivers of all their good from God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here obſerve, that the perfection of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the eſtate of pure naturalls, had no dependancie upon <hi>Adams</hi> Perſonall perfections; or his perfect operations, whereby they could keepe, or loſe their created perfections by him; therefore it was from ſome other cauſe, whereby they became ſubject to fall into vanity; for in this eſtate <hi>Adam</hi> depended upon them for the ſupport of his Perſonall perfections and operations, but not they upon him; for they were created in their flouriſhing perfections before <hi>Adam</hi> was: All being made, firſt in their immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancie upon God; but hee laſt: therefore in this eſtate they had no ſuch dependancie upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here obſerve, that man perfect in holineſſe and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156664:11"/> righteouſneſſe, did not by falſe apprehenſions, interpoſe the good in the Creatures, betwixt <hi>God</hi> and him, to cut off his bleſſed union of love to <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>God</hi> from him, for hee by that perfect love loded himſelfe, and all that created good in <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> from whom it came, and ſo returning to <hi>God</hi> the glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of all his workes which hee had created and made, and ſo gave <hi>God</hi> full content.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerve that in the eſtate of perfect Creation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the world, <hi>God</hi> eſtabliſh'd his Glory to returne to him, in a mutuall concordancie of mans good, and no otherwiſe; and therefore the ſtate of Creation produced man good, and no evill; for <hi>God</hi> looked upon all, and ſaw it was all good, as liking it well.</p>
               <p>Fiftly obſerve, that although <hi>Adam</hi> did beleeve <hi>God</hi> to be being and bleſſedneſſe in himſelf and of himſelfe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all bleſſedneſſe to him, yet this eſtate to <hi>Adam</hi> was not an eſtate of Faith, for <hi>Adams</hi> beliefe of all this, did ariſe to him by naturall demonſtration, from the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Creation, according with the perfection of his Senſes, and Reaſon, and ſo to his will.</p>
               <p>Therefore all to him was but Naturall; but in an eſtate of Faith, to live by Faith in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt for the thing beleeved, it muſt be Supernaturall. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, man his minde muſt depend for the attayning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of it upon the credit he gives to the word of <hi>God,</hi> which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares the thing to him, but ſo was not this Eſtate, and therefore this was not an Eſtate of Faith to <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his next eſtate to this, was an Eſtate of Faith; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the worke of the Covenant, which is the next ground to be treated of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo much for</hi> Adams <hi>firſt Eſtate, being naturally perfect in all.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe here was Conditions betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> for life and death; I ſay for life and death, to <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankinde comprehended in generall, under the names of good and evill, good to be rendered, if hee did obey the Rule of the Covenant, evill if he did diſobey it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe conditions were agreed on by <hi>Adam,</hi> with a full conſent, he being then not only in the perfections of the ſecond Table of the Law, as to love his Neighbour as himſelfe; but alſo in the perfection of the firſt Table of the Law, namely, in the truth, and utmoſt extent of his love to God. <hi>with all his Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But for the cleare opening of this Second Eſtate, I will propound foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what this Garden was.</p>

               <p n="4">4 What was the end <hi>God</hi> intended by <hi>Adams</hi> obedience in this Covenant,</p>
               <p>Firſt, this Garden was but a part of the Terreſtriall Globe, for ſaith the Text, <hi>The Lord God planted a Garden Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in Eden,</hi> therefore but a part. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:156664:12"/>
               <p>This Garden was planted by God with Plants, ſome for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

               <p>This Plantation or Garden being thus finiſhed, <hi>Adam</hi> by God was thither conveyed, and the perfections thereof, was to depend upon his operations; for ſaith the Text. <hi>The Lord God tooke the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dreſſe it, and to keepe it,</hi> Verſe 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo much for what this plantation was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly this was for ſome further end and uſe, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was the perfections of the whole terreſtriall Globe,; for all the trees of this Plantation or Garden, were vegetables in their perfections, as were thoſe on the whole terreſtriall Globe: Therefore this Garden, as a plantation by ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſignification) made the onely difference between it and the world.</p>
               <p>And the ſignification in generall, was but this; that as in future time the land of Canaan, with all it's fruitfull ſplendor, did prefigure the celeſtiall Canaan. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> as appeares <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. So this to <hi>Adam</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time did prefigure the ſame Angelicall felicity of Divine glory in the Heaven of heavens.</p>
               <p>From this ground God made the Garden to excell the glory of the whole terreſtriall globe, that by faith <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule might be raiſed to worke by love to God, feeding on Angells food by beliefe of truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much for the generall ſignification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, more particularly: Firſt, whereas God did not commit the whole terreſtriall globe, but onely this part,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156664:13"/> (as the glory of the world) to <hi>Adams</hi> dreſſing and keeping.</p>
               <p>This figuratively implies, that now by vertue of Gods Ordinance, the creation had it's dependence for it's good, naturall and ſupernaturall; or for an evill equivalently contrary upon <hi>Adams</hi> operations in this Covenant. And here came in the onely ground, how by <hi>Adam</hi> the creation could be raiſed higher, or loſe it's ſupernaturall perfections, and become ſubject to vanity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Whereas God cauſed to grow up in the midſt of the Garden a naturall tree, naming it the Teee of life; this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he (to his naturall poſterity, in obeying the worke of the Covenant by beliefe of truth) ſhould (from Divine Juſtice) be as a tree in his branches of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfections, growing up to a celeſtiall life; or as a flouriſhing tree of eternall life. But now this tree of life is onely in Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to all right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.</p>

               <p>And the ground why God inſtituted this Garden thus, in all theſe prefigurations and ſignifications was this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the heavenly glory to <hi>Adams</hi> terreſtriall perfections, was ſupernaturall; for it is one thing for <hi>Adam</hi> to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And another thing, that hee had created it, and would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156664:13"/> bring him to it, if hee did obey the rule of the Covenant; for the perfections of the creation did demonſtrate to <hi>Adam,</hi> that God was able to doe ſuch a thing, but no more but the Covenant by God Word was expreſt for a contrary evill.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe prefigurations and ſignifications from the agreeableneſſe of the type with the antitype, did make knowne to <hi>Adam,</hi> that the ſupernaturall glory was made, and in being alſo from the word knowledge of good, that he ſhould aſcend to enjoy it to all eternity, if hee did obey the rule of the Covenant, or an evill equivalently contrary if he did diſobey; and therefore, becauſe ſupernaturall, all was needfull to ſtrengthen <hi>Adams</hi> faith, to withſtand the temptation, in point of triall,<note place="margin">See this point cleared to the 13.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, now <hi>Adam</hi> was to obey two rules in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> one affirmative, the other negative. The affirmative was to this end, namely, to continue his naturall being to be a meanes to a ſupernaturall end, by eating the fruits of this Garden: for as in the precedent eſtate of creation, hee was to eate of the fruit of the creation for his nutrimentall ſuſtentation; ſo now of the fruits of this Garden alſo; for the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, <hi>Of every tree of the Garden thou mayeſt eate freely,</hi> Gen. 1.29. Gen. 2.16.</p>
               <p>The negative rule was it by which hee was to improve his ſtrength of body and mind to God by obedience, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the forbearing to eate of the tree of knowledge of good and evill; <hi>but of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill thou ſhalt not eate, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 2.17.</p>
               <p>And this rule led him to be both paſſively and actively obedient, paſſively in two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, although in the perfection of the creation, all things good for food was due to him by Gods allowance without reſtraint, yet in this Garden or Plantation, by this rule hee was to ſuffer this reſtraint, namely, to deny himſelfe to eate of the fruit of this Tree of knowledge of good and evill, upon paine of moſt dreadfull conſequences; for, ſaith the Text, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt certainly die the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Although in the perfection of the creation, God rendred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his ſweete imbreathings, very good, and no evill, yet in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156664:14"/> this Garden the obedience of theſe rules bound them to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the imbreathings of the aſſaults of Satan that evill one in point of triall.<note n="(a)" place="margin">As did the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Luk. 4.3, 2.3.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And here lay the life of their obedience; for without this aſſault their triall had beene no triall to the improvement of their naturall perfections of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe to Gods Covenant in point of good and evill.</p>
               <p>And againe, this negative rule led them to active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in two particulars: firſt the fruits of this tree of good and evill being naturally good food, it required of them a diligent obſervation of their naturall appetite, leſt it might diſpoſe them to tranſgreſſe the rule of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>This rule led them in ſtead of feeding their bodies with the fruit of this tree, to feed their ſoules by beliefe of the ſignified knowledge of good, equivalent to Angels in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or with the ſignified knowledge of evill equivalently contrary in eternall miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much for this point, what <hi>Adams</hi> obedience in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the intended end of Gods Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> was of great conſequence, for it reſpected God, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, the World, and the Divell; for what if Satans lye to the woman, pretended that there was no truth in Gods word, for their death, if they did tranſgreſſe, ſaying, <hi>yee ſhall not die at all:</hi> and what if Satan did make God to them to be but a meere impoſture, as only pretending, that Angelicall good, but never intended it, for to the woman (in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) he ſaid, God <hi>doth know that in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſay, what of all this? for if hee had (in beliefe of Gods word) abſtayned from eating the fruit, according to the rule of the Covenant, then they had not only freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from being murthered, the world had not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, Gods word had not been nullified Satan had not (in the beliefe of his lyes) bin magnified b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Opening the State of the world by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</head>
               <p>AS the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> extended to himſelfe, and to all his poſterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. ſo it brought him and his poſterity from the higheſt ſpire<note n="*" place="margin">The infinite God bound himſelfe for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his perſonal perfections by the rules of the Covenant, and the reaſons why hee did not ſo, ſee from <hi>pag.</hi> 17. to <hi>pag.</hi> 20. and in <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> of the knowledge of God, to the deepeſt gulfe of the knowledge of evill.</p>
               <p>And whereas both are referred to the knowledge which is in man; the reaſon is, becauſe man is moſt capable of his higheſt felicity, or of his deepeſt miſery, onely by his knowable powers, which was alſo implyed in this, that the tree of triall was called the tree of knowledge of good and evill.</p>
               <p>But here may be demanded, what <hi>Adam</hi> and wee his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity loſt, and what we loſt not, and what wee found by his fall. <label type="milestone">

                  </label>

               <p>Firſt, we loſt the perfection of the whole creation wholly. <label type="milestone">

                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we loſt the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> as it was an object of faith, the figure of the felicity of Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we loſt totally our pure naturals, that is, the perfection of both Tables of the Law, as containing our righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, the moſt expreſſe Image of God by creation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee loſt the beginning of our ſupernaturall righteouſneſſe and holineſſe contained in the inſtitution of the Covenant for we loſt that eſtate of faith.</p>
               <p>Wee loſt the ultimate perfection of ſupernaturall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by which we ſhould enjoy God in his moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> expreſſions of his eſſentiall perfections in the glory of Angels; and in a word, we loſt all the good of this world, and that to come.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:156664:17"/>
               <p>Secondly, that which we loſt not, in briefe was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt we loſt not the being of this creation, but the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We loſt not the Eſſence of our reaſonable ſoules, nor their eſſentiall faculties; as memory, conſcience, will, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, for all theſe remaine in men under eternall death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Wee loſt not a body proper to our kind, nor a perſonall union of both ſoule and body together; for theſe, men alſo have under eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much for what we loſt, and what we loſt not.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> We found the knowledge of evill; as firſt the evill of tranſgreſſion: ſecondly the evill of puniſhment, and of the evill of tranſgreſſion, the firſt root of bitterneſſe, did ariſe from <hi>Adams</hi> remiſſeneſſe of this ſecond ſtate contained in the condition of the Covenant; and this appeares by his ſinne of omiſſion, which brought on his ſinne of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, generally in two things, but particularly in ſix things.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt his eating the fruits of this plantation generally by Gods more ſpeciall appointment, as a meanes to bring him to an higher end then did his food in the perfection of the creation how could he then have omitted this generall help to that ſupernaturall end, if hee had not beene rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this Garden being ſo ſequeſtred from all the terreſtriall globe and in plants for pleaſantneſſe, tranſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſurmounting all the terreſtriall globe prefiguring generally to <hi>Adams</hi> faith, the pleaſures and felicity of Angels, how could he then have omitted this univerſall help, if he had not beene remiſſe of the conditions compriſed in the Covenant? <hi>So much for theſe in generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Againe, more particularly; firſt his worke aſſigned him by Divine inſtitution to dreſſe and keepe this choyce part of the whole creation by the worke of his fingers prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto him, that the perfection of the creation depended on his worke in the Covenant for good and evill.</p>
               <p>And how could he then omit this prefiguration for a help, if he had not bin remiſſe by a ſleepy faith in this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when he looked on the tree of life, in it's flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing perfections in all the branches thereof, as prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156664:17"/> to him his naturall branches or off-ſpring, depended on him in the worke of the Covenant for celeſtiall felicity, how could he then have omitted this helpe to lead his faith to the negative rule of the Covenant, if he had not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in this particular?</p>
               <p>Thirdly he knowing all the fruits of the trees in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his, to eate without reſtraint, excepting this one tree of good and evill, how therefore could hee omit the deniall of himſelfe, this one thing to attaine the good compriſed in the Covenant, if hee had not beene remiſſe in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular?</p>
               <p>God threatning him moſt expreſſely with death, yea, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> moſt certaine death, if he did not abſtaine from eating that forbidden fruit, how then could hee omit this helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Satans aſſault, by whom or by what mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſoever ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to avoid ſo dangerous a conſequence, if hee had not beene remiſſe of the conditions of the Covenant?</p>
               <p>His eyes ſeeing that River comming in but one way into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Garden, yet divided into foure in that Paradiſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and thence iſſuing it's chryſtall ſtreames of waters of life as from the Throne of God, downe the terreſtriall globe foure wayes, prefiguring to him the good compriſed in the Covenant, as running downe from Gods moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous juſtice to his poſterity throughout all generations, for his glorifying Gods truth and faithfulneſſe by denying the fruit of this forbidden tree, how could hee then omit this as a helpe, to ſet his faith on worke, if he had not beene remiſſe of the good compriſed in the Covenant?</p>
               <p>When his eyes beheld this tree of Knowledge of good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and evill, or the fruit of it, how could he omit to ſet his faith on worke, to feed his ſoule with it's ſignification, of the good, if hee did abſtaine? or a fall into the contrary evill, if he did eate; and how durſt he feed his body with this fruit, to the ruine of him and all the world, and his poſterity, if hee had not beene remiſſe of all compriſed in the conditirn of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now, as <hi>Adams</hi> remiſſeneſſe brought on this ſinne of omiſſion, ſo his ſin of omiſſion brought on his ſin of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, namely, the eating of the forbidden fruit; for when the divell in the Serpent told them, ſaying, yee ſhall not die at all; and alſo that their obedience to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, denying themſelves that fruit, was the onely thing

               <p>The firſt is, <hi>that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the ſecond Adam.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He was appointed by God ſo to be before the world was, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes that that felicitie which was loſt, and which men now or ever hereafter ſhall attaine unto, was appointed with him for them by God <hi>before the world was,</hi> Titus 1.5.

So alſo himſelfe ſaith, <hi>the houre is come,</hi> Mark. 14.41.</p>
               <p>Againe, and the very houre in which he did finiſh all righteouſneſſe by the expiration of his life, as a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory ſacrifice to Divine juſtice, as the Lambe of God, is expreſly ſet downe to be the ſixth day of the weeke, and ninth houre of that day, implying this was the day of the week, and houre of that day in which he firſt in the Lambs blood did render up his life figuratively, then in the type, and now in the truth, the one anſwering the other in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time in the agreeableneſſe of the type with the antitype. And therefore rightly doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> take it for granted, that <hi>Chriſt was the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. For the world received that ſixth day a threefold beginning:</p>
               <p>The firſt was the ſpire of perfection by creation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the world received the beginning of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall perfection, founded in the covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When all being loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, the foundation for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of all, was laid in the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> worke of the Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, the unconceiveable danger required, that Chriſt as the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the Lambs blood, muſt enter the worke in that minute that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, otherwiſe juſtice muſt have proceeded immediatly to bring the judgement paſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to an unconceiveable execution, therefore hee entred the worke of the Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, he onely and alone in that point of time, did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this worke, becauſe hee onely and alone, was the ſpotleſſe Lambe, or the ſinleſſe man, in that figure, and therefore onely and alone fit for that worke.</p>
               <p>Again he only and alone, was the lamb of God perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God-man in this figure: therefore he only and alone, fitly able under flames of ſcorching wrath, to undertake the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the juſtice of the Covenant, by perfect flames of burning love in his pure naturalls, as a meanes by love ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, to attaine the ſuperceleſtiall felicity of the glory of Angells by taking upon him the imputed guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and that dreadfull execution which immediately muſt have paſt for the ſame. <hi>So much for the third point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That by Chriſt his undertaking the worke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, hee removed for ever the judgement which paſſed on all men to condemnation, and therefore it never paſſed to execution, not ſo much as to any one mans damnation for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt no ſooner undertooke to anſwer the juſtice of the Covenant in the type but in ſtead of immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, God in Chriſt manifeſted himſelfe, reconciling the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinne, ſeeking to ſave that which was loſt, ſaying to <hi>Adam, Where art thou? What haſt thou done? &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 3. verſe 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, and that hee was ſo reconciling is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the 15. verſe. For God having curſed the Serpent, hee then manifeſted the deliverance by Chriſt, ſaying to Satan in the Serpent, <hi>I will put enmity betweene thee and the woman, and betweene her ſeed and thy ſeed, it ſhall breake thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas the juſtice of the Covenant required, the production of all mankind unnaturally, from croſſe operations in the powers of the whole creation, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3. yet now comes God and gives us a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall production of all mankinde, by a mercifull promiſe in a two-fold reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, to the ſeed of the woman with no promiſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſorrow to his conception or production, that is Chriſt, as the firſt in nature borne from the dead fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> of every creature reſtoring Gods Image in all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:156664:21"/>
               <p>Secondly, a promiſe of a naturall conception and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of all mankinde, but with the addition of the taſte of ſower herbes of ſorrow; for un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the woman he ſaid, <hi>I will greatly increaſe thy ſorrow and thy conception, In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth thy children,</hi> verſe 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, juſtice from the Covenant required mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſupport from the power of God, in the torturous powers of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>But now God gives a nutrimentall ſupport by food na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and onely with a taſte of the ſowre herbs of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>For unto the man,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>becauſe thou haſt harkened unto the voyce of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree which I commanded, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eat of it,</hi> but ſaith not in the words of the Covenant, <hi>thou ſhalt certainly die the death,</hi> but ſaith onely this, <hi>Curſed is the earth for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, the juſtice of the Covenant admitted no ſeparation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of ſoule and body, but our deſcent to our deepeſt torment, muſt have bin in perſonall union of ſoule &amp; body together.</p>
               <p>But now there is a ſeparation, and mans body hath a time of reſt in the duſt: this is implyed in this Text, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now put all this ſorrow together, and then it is no more but this, Even ſowre herbs for man to reliſh his ſweet mercy in the Lambe of God by whom hee paſſeth over all his wrath, for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, by which we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably rejected and reprobated with divels from God by the juſtice of the Covenant: but according as God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed Chriſt, and choſe us in him before the foundation of the world, that wee ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love; ſo hee elected us in his beloved, from reprobate divels, with whom in juſtice wee were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. But becauſe this deepe myſterie is wrapt up in that of <hi>Geneſ</hi> 3.15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 18. therefore I will briefly open theſe two Texts, before I paſſe to the fifth point. <hi>viz.</hi> Unto Satan he ſaid. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas God ſaith to the Divell <hi>I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thee &amp; the woman</hi> is firſt implyed that God only could, as the caſe then ſtood, produce this enmity in this word <hi>I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly that his will was reſolved ſo to doe, in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> word. <hi>I w ll.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:156664:22"/>
               <p>That the Divell formerly conceived, if he could but get the woman into amity by beliefe of his lies, then the juſtice of the Covenant would not admit to diſſolve that amity, much leſſe to put enmity: but to Satan, ſaith God, <hi>I will put enmity betweene thee and the woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, here ariſeth a three-fold quere: firſt, what is meant by this word <hi>put:</hi> ſecondly, what is meant by this word <hi>enmity:</hi> thirdly, what is meant by this word <hi>woman:</hi>

And the truth is the naturall force of this infuſion being by man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, he having not the written Oracle of God, it will terminate in the circumciſion of mans heart, as is clearely proved in the ſeventh <hi>Chapter</hi> following: Secondly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably as there is any diſpoſition of the law in mans heart, tending towards God by Chriſt, anſwerably the ſame tends to this enmity with Satan but more, as the ſame diſpoſition is reduced to act towards God, according to truth; for the ſame diſpoſition is enmity to Satan even as the Amity of this world is enmity with God, ſo amity with God is enmity with Satan; and in a word, this infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is moſt properly this enmity with Satan, when it comes to the degree of faith, actually to receive Chriſt his imputative righteouſneſſe, as Gods gift to ſalvation, and his rule for imitation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by <hi>Woman</hi> in this Text is not meant womans individuall perſon reſtrictively but this word <hi>Woman,</hi> is the woman collectively meant, as drawing all mankinde in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, into condemnation; for example,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156664:22"/> in the 16. Verſe, when God ſaid to the <hi>Woman, I will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe thy ſorrowes and thy conceptions, in ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Here by <hi>Woman</hi> hee ſpeakes Relatively, as to all women which ſhall conceive and bring forth, and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which ſhall be conceived and borne; ſo is this word <hi>Woman</hi> collectively in this Text, to be underſtood of all mankind, implying, that this amity by internall diſpoſition to God in Chriſt, was by God infuſed univerſally into the nature of mankinde, to deſcend hereditarily in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conceptions, whereas in juſtice, none was left before in the fall, but contrary diſpoſitions to evill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the next word, God ſaith to Satan, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> and becauſe the Text ſaith not onely, <hi>I will put enmity</hi>

                  <hi>betweene thee and the woman,</hi> here is a further matter implyed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by this word <hi>Seed,</hi> what ſeed ſoever it was, it was certainly the ſeed of the Divell, conteined in this word, <hi>thy ſeed,</hi> and in a word, this <hi>ſeed</hi> was the foreſaid diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mans acquired operations, which entred origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally into the nature of man, by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne totally and eternally, to remaine according to the juſtice of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as is declared, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And becauſe in this Text God calls it by the name of a <hi>ſeed,</hi> it further implyes, that by Chriſts anſwering of the juſtice of the Covenant, in the blood of the Lambe, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Divells (namely originall ſinne) in the nature of man is by grace reduced but to a <hi>ſeed;</hi> and it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe Gods foreſaid infuſion did imprint the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of amity to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And therefore from this ground onely mankinde now is conceived and borne, but with the <hi>ſeed</hi> of originall ſinne, and not divels, totally and eternally, as juſtice required; and this is the onely ground, why men are in naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions better than divels.</p>
               <p>Againe, by this word <hi>her ſeed,</hi> is implicitly meant. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in one nature, and eſſentially; the one God and ſecond perſon in the ſacred Eſſence: and alſo in his other nature, the nature of all mankinde in the <hi>Womans ſeed;</hi> and in a word, here is meant his perſonall union, as God-man, by this reſtriction, <hi>her ſeed,</hi> not of ſeeds as of many, but of one which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Gal 3.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:156664:23"/>
               <p>Againe this word (and) relates the precedent words, <hi>Put</hi> and <hi>enmity,</hi> to Chriſt alſo, to be betweene the Serpent and him, for as I noted before, that the promiſe of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was without the promiſe of addition of the taſt of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo alſo this word, <hi>put,</hi> as related to him, implies his conception and birth, not only without the internall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of originall ſinne, but alſo that his conception and birth was in its pure naturalls, totally diſpoſed to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holyneſſe, in all perfections, for his Mother being overſhaddowed, by the holy Ghoſt, by which God put this <hi>enmity</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Seed therefore which was borne, was called a holy thing, and ſo <hi>enmity</hi> in a ſuperlative ſenſe; <hi>I will put enmity betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed:</hi> but here note, that that Amity with God, which was enmity to Satan, which was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all mankinde by infuſion, and into Chriſts humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more then miraculouſly, was in the generall nature one and the ſame diſpoſition: for as Chriſt is pittifull, ſo mankinde is naturally inclined to pitty; likewiſe as Chriſt is mercifull, ſo mankinde is naturally inclined to mercy; and as Chriſt worſhiped God purely, ſo mankinde is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to worſhip a Deity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in another reſpect farre different, for that in men there alwaies remaines ſome ſeed of the Serpent, at beſt in this life, and therefore perfect but in part but the perfections in Chriſt from his conception to his expiration of his life, was in all the degrees of naturall righteouſneſſe and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a meanes by Faith and love ſupernaturall, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth of God againſt Satans lyes, or Serpentine ſeed in men or Divells, diſſolving the works of Satan, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe words, <hi>It ſhall breake thy head,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the eight Chapter.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the third place, <hi>to the Serpent</hi> ſaith God, <hi>thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele,</hi> and in this point Chriſt is conſiderable in a foure fold reſpect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as him in whom God elected<note n="*" place="margin">Note that this univerſall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the meere favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy of God, ſo is alſo that ſecond ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination in the beginning of the 6.

Yet as God then left them, and choſe us in Chriſt from them; ſo by him then were all men ſaved from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative damnation of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: wherefore in this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156664:23"/> reſpect, all mankinde is the heele of Chriſt in this relation. But from this relation Satan drawes us in our remiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by lying vanities to forſake our own mercies, and ſo to periſh, not for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, but for our owne, againſt this grace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo are bruiſed by Satan, <hi>for thou ſhall bruiſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as God is the Saviour of all men from <hi>Adams</hi> imputative damnation, ſo more eſpecially hee is the Saviour of them that beleeve, and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by pardoning their owne perſonall tranſgreſſions, againſt this univerſall mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by eſtating them in that eternall life by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they loſt by their owne ſinne, and in <hi>Adams, for</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, he that beleeveth in me, hath eternall life, and is paſt from death unto life:</hi> And becauſe theſe men by beliefe of truth, ſet to their Seales that God is true in his guift of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his righteouſneſſe imputed, and in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts in ſome degree of inherent righteouſneſſe, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Gods truth againſt Satans lies, or lying vanities; Therefore Satan by tentations, and other envyous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as by <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abell,</hi> doth bruiſe this heele of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or but his heele, for this company of the Faithfull here Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in compariſon of that with <hi>Chriſt</hi> triumphing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, is but the heele of <hi>Chriſt, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did apply all the power of his pure Naturalls of <hi>holineſse,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> a meanes witneſſing Gods word of truth for good, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, oppoſing Satans lyes: therefore Satan by himſelfe, or men adhering to him, did by envious operations (as he did by <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abel</hi>) cruſh <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, yet it did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh his Faith and love to God and his Neighbour in the leaſt degree, but drew it out the more, as in due place it will appeare.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe envious operations, being but extended to the affliction of his body and ſoule, being his nature hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, the loweſt nature in his Sacred Perſon, therefore it was but his heele, as it was foretold, <hi>thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly againe, as if God ſhould ſay to Satan, true it is, that in the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> faithleſſe fall from me, thou didſt devour all, both heele, body and head but againſt this the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whom I wil raiſe up in the nature of all men,

               <p>Firſt, that in the next verſe before this, <hi>Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is called the <hi>guift of righteouſneſſe,</hi> but in this Text it is ſpoken as if <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> were the procuring cauſe of the <hi>guift</hi> of it ſelfe, as imputed to come upon all men, and the truth is ſo it was, for had not <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> in the figurative lamb, to the juſtice of the Covenant in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, anſwered the <hi>imputative unrighteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not imputatively by free guift, have come, as it did upon all men, to the juſtification of life, for till the juſtice of the Covenant was ſo ſatisfied, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God was willing to impute it to life) yet he could not, for as God cannot lye, ſo he cannot deny his truth, but all mankinde muſt certainly have dyed, (according to Gods-word) that death in the day that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here note, that this <hi>free guift</hi> of <hi>Chriſts imputative righteouſneſſe</hi> came at this time on all men unfought for, or unthought on by them; for when God brought this guift to them, <hi>Adam</hi> runne away from him, therefore here, <hi>God wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, mans owne <hi>works</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> was not his <hi>juſtification,</hi> nor no good works foreſeene; for as now man by the fall, his works were onely ſo euill as the Divells, ſo all mens works but <hi>Chriſts works</hi> in this fourth eſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, at beſt are but in the perfection of parts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Serpentine ſeed, which hereditarily runnes down, in the nature of all mankinde; and therefore rightly ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his owne purpoſe, and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Ieſus before the World began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe obſerve that this <hi>juſtification</hi> not onely freed all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mankinde, from dying the death the day that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, but alſo brought life upon all men, for ſaith the <hi>Text, it came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>So much for the fourth point, Namely, that Chriſt entring the worke of the Covenant as the ſecond Adam, removed that judgement that was due to all man-kind. So as never man periſhed for <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden Fruit.</hi>

               <p>And that this travailing of the whole Creation, together with man, was by Chriſt, is moſt cleerely proved, by what is formerly delivered, that is, when this glorious Image of the Inviſible God,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</note> was loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, then the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> the Sonne of God, reſtored the Image of the inviſible God, by coming into the worke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as <hi>the firſt borne of every Creature, the beginning and firſt borne from the dead fall of</hi> Adam in the promiſed ſeed, <hi>that in all things he might have the preeminence.</hi> Coloſſ. 1.15.18. All which, when <hi>Adam</hi> by Faith in the State of the reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſee, thereupon he named his wife <hi>Eve,</hi> which ſignifieth life: Firſt becauſe in Chriſt <hi>ſhee was now become the Mother of all living,</hi> Gen. 3.20. wherefore ſhe alſo in beliefe of truth ſaith, when ſhe had conceived and brought forth Caine, <hi>I have gotten a man from IEHOVAH,</hi> meaning, not by the force of Gods word in the State of Creation. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. for that was loſt by the fall, and therefore God in Chriſt gives a ſecond word of production to them, which was now a word of grace and object of <hi>Faith</hi> in the promiſed ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.16.

                  </label> It extends exceeding farre in this caſe alſo, even to any man ſubmitting by beliefe of truth, to receive this <hi>gift of righteouſneſſe, as the truth is in Ieſus;</hi> for then it takes off all manner of ſinne committed againſt him, (one ſinne onely excepted) for, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>All manner of ſinne and blaſphemy againſt the Sonne of man ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men,</hi> Mark. 3.</p>
               <p>And the ground why God thus foreappointed <hi>Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was,</hi> to be ready as the Ram in the buſh, in that point of time, to enter the worke of the Covenant, to take off the juſt deſtruction of the world, and to ſtate it thus, to travell together with man-believing truth, to it's deſired felicity, was onely this: namely, <hi>Gods love to the world;</hi> for, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the world muſt be onely conſidered, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject agreeable to Gods will, becauſe it was to him an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of love; for the truth is, God did ſo conſider it, and that in a two-fold reſpect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in all that good which God communicated to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> world by creation, as involved in the Covenant to it's ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate perfection, and all this, as iſſuing from himſelfe, was his owne effect, as the off-ſpring of God, and therefore a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:156664:28"/> good every way agreeable to Gods will, and an object of love to him.</p>
               <p>But if the juſtice of the Covenant had paſſed to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then God had proceeded to annihilate all this good, not onely in part, but totally and eternally; but this went againſt his mind, therefore, <hi>hee ſo loved the world, that hee gave his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That glory which was to reſult to God out of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> good of the creatures, according to the ſpire of perfection of the Covenant, by <hi>Adams</hi> ſupernaturall operation, was Gods finall end for which he made all, namely, his glory, and this was to God the object of good in the higheſt reſpect.</p>
               <p>But if God had in the juſtice of the Covenant proceeded to execution, then this his finall end had beene ſeparated from him, and he might in the ruine and deſtruction of the creatures to all eternitie have glorified himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But from the creatures good his glory could never have returned to him in any degree, much leſſe from the higheſt ſpire of perfection intended in the Covenant, as was Gods deſire, but this was contrary to his mind; therefore <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, as his Lambe, to take away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> by regaining his glory in the redundancie thereof, to the eternall praiſe of his mercy.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that by this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> his ſatisfaction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, God in mercy gave to all mankinde alike, the meanes and end, namely, <hi>Eternall life,</hi> and that the good of this world is a remote meanes to the ſame end, as here wee ſee?</p>
               <p>Then hence obſerve, that all men, either poore or rich, which deſire or indeavour to attaine the good of this world for them and theirs, and not as a means to this end, they then in their imaginations and all their labours, are but a mere lye and vanity; whence rightly ſaith the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye,</hi> Pſal. 62.9.</p>
               <p>Againe, is the good of this world, <hi>Gods gift in Chriſt,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt part, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.13. the Apoſtle to the praiſe of Gods univerſall grace, parallelling the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> hee there layes downe a double Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the firſt, that although by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, ſinne entred into the world, that is, originally, as the cauſe of all mens periſhing when they were dependant on him in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for afterwards hee was (as are all men, Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) but a private man, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. So that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as now it is, is but the occaſion of mans ſinne, by his owne default to his eternall deſtruction, and their owne ſinne, is the onely cauſe thereof, as committed againſt Chriſt, and the ground thereof is expreſt by the Apoſtle in the 18. verſe following.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is further implyed, in theſe two verſes, that that mans ſinnes now ſo committed, that is, againſt Chriſt to whom all power is given, and to whom all ſtand rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for good and evill, that the prevalency of their ſinne againſt him, doth increaſe the prevalency of the ſhadow of death unto them, namely, the frequency of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule from the body, and alſo of death in the ſubſtance, namely, mans ſeparation from God his chiefeſt good, in this relation, and united to the contrary evill, and by his owne remiſſeneſſe, being ignorant of all; yet then God in mercy to the promiſe, added the Law to reveale, to reckon or impute mans ſinne unto him, that he might ſee how hee runne on his owne miſery; wherefore, in the 20. verſe, rightly ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Law entred, that the offence</hi> (as the ſpring of miſery) <hi>might abound, that where ſinne abounded, grace might much more abound, that as ſinne had raigned unto death, even ſo might grace raigne through righteouſneſſe unto eternall life by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> verſe 21.

               <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>God</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now leaſt hee put forth his hand and take of the tree of life, and live for ever,</hi> herein God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly cuts him off from the touch or taſt of eternall life, according to the precedent figures of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Againe, when the text ſaith, <hi>Therefore the</hi> Lord God <hi>ſent him forth from the Garden of</hi> Eden <hi>to till the ground from whence he was taken:</hi> It implies, that then God gave <hi>Adam</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, he was now but a private man, as all his off-ſpring ſhould be, <hi>Chriſt</hi> only excepted, and therefore neither the Creation nor mankinde, had dependancie upon his worke for good and evill, as in the Covenant precedently they had.</p>

               <p>Secondly, he offered it not to Idoles, but to <hi>Iehovah;</hi> and this was well: and becauſe the Text relates his offering with no further commendations, it implies that no more good could be ſpoken of it, according to truth: <hi>So much for hat was well.</hi>

               <p>And for this, God comes againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> for ſaith Moſes, <hi>Iehovah ſaith unto</hi> Cain, <hi>where is</hi> Abell <hi>thy Brother?

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:156664:35"/> remained in a world of ſinfull men; for, <hi>it ſhall breake thy head,</hi> wherefore this Praiſer of God alſo leaves his minde to the world by tradition, in the name of his ſonne, calling him <hi>Iared,</hi> that is, <hi>deſcending,</hi> ſaith <hi>Broughton,</hi> foretelling the worlds deſcent in ungodlines to miſery as without hope of returne; wherefore this hopeleſſe man names his Son <hi>Enoch</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Broughton</hi>) ſignifying dedicated, or conſecrated to God, implying he would dedicate him and his to God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, though the ſtream of the world run a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, <hi>following lying vanities, forſaking their owne mercies.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Wherefore this man leaves his mind by tradition to the world in the name of his ſonne alſo; for he called him <hi>Methuſalah,</hi> that is, (as ſaith <hi>Broughton) God ſends,</hi> that is, his certaine judgement upon the wicked of the world.</p>

               <p>Yet here we muſt not judge, that all that periſhed in this temporall judgement, periſhed <hi>eternally:</hi> For godly men ſometimes in Gods generall judgements, are ſwept away for their great remiſſeneſſe to <hi>Gods</hi> great mercies, extended to them, and yet paſſe through that ſhade of death to <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> as did good old <hi>Eli</hi> and as did meeke <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe carkaſſe fell in the wilderneſſe amongſt the reſt, yet <hi>God</hi> let him ſee the terreſtriall <hi>Canaan</hi> a figure of the celeſtiall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as a pledge of his ſure paſſage through that ſhade of

               <p>But in the number eight another thing is meant namely, as an eighth day was to be the <hi>promiſed ſeed,</hi> his reſurrection day, therefore here the number of eight as referred onely to <hi>Noah,</hi> implyed, that although the other ſeven were ſaved from that flood in the Ark, ye: <hi>Noah</hi> only then was ſaved in it as riſen with <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> in the object of <hi>juſtification,</hi> by which he built the Arke to the ſaving of his houſe, by which he condemned the world, and <hi>became heire of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is by faith,</hi> Hebr. 11.7. figuratively implying, that God in Chriſt is the Saviour of all men, from <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and more to live in this day of Grace, to receive by <hi>faith</hi> his <hi>free guift of life</hi> in glory, yet his ſalvation is more ſpeciall to them that <hi>believe,</hi> as here in <hi>Noah</hi> wee ſee, and as before is noted, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>And accordingly in the next Chapter, God againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes his mercifull production, of mankinde: for,<note place="margin">This is the third producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind given by God: the firſt before the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. the ſecond by Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and reſtorer of all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. the third is this, mercifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration.</note> ſaith <hi>Moſes, God bleſſed</hi> Noah <hi>and his ſonnes, and ſaid unto them, be fruitfull and multiply, and repleniſh the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo he gave man right over the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and a Law to eate fleſh, letting out the blood thereof: alſo a law againſt murthering of mankind, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2.3. And commands them to conſider all this, to be the renewing of his Covenant of Grace univerſally to all mankind.</p>
               <p>For, ſaith <hi>Moſes, God ſaith unto</hi> Noah, <hi>and his ſonnes with him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And I, behold, I eſtabliſh my covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you for ever, and with every creature that is with you</hi> v. 8.</p>
               <p>Alſo God gave them the Rain-bow as a witneſſe of this mercy to perpetuall generation, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. ſaith God, the Bow ſhall be in the cloud, I will looke upon it, that I may remember the everlaſting Covenant betweene God and every living creature of all fleſh that is upon the earth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the next place, <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us the manner of the proceedings betweene God and this new Generation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. He tells us, <hi>the whole earth was then of one language,</hi> and alſo in proceſſe of time, whither they journed and at length ſetled; For he ſaith, <hi>it came to paſſe as they journied from the Eaſt, they found a plaine in the Land of Shynar, and they dwelt there:</hi> Alſo hee tels what they ſaid, and what they did with an unanimous conſent. They ſaid one to another, <hi>Goe too, let us make bricke, and burne them throughly, and they had bricke for ſtone, and ſlime had they for morter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſaid, goe too, let us build us a City and a Tower, whoſe top may reach unto Heaven.</hi> And then hee tels us to what end and purpoſe was this great building ſet up, by all theſe great Counſell, coſt and labour, namely, <hi>that their owne
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:156664:37"/> imaginations, and the worke of their owne hands might get them an immortall Name and Fame on earth;</hi> For they ſaid, <hi>Let us make us a name, leſt we be ſcattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This implies they all were now in this plaine Reſident, and alſo their apoſtaſie univerſally from God in the Pillar of truth in which Oracle was wrapt up the gift of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and immortall good; for from it wee ſee upon <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice he conveyed to them and theirs, all happineſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to come: So here you ſee the manner of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of this new generation towards God for all his gracious mercy by the <hi>promiſed ſeed</hi> his ſatisfactory <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, it followes in what manner God proceeded for this to them, ſaith <hi>Moſes, Iehovah came downe to ſee the City and the Tower that the children of men builded, and Iehovah ſaid, the people are all one, and they have all one language, and this they begin to doe, and nothing will reſtraine them from that which they have imagined to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words imply two things; firſt, that this building to the foreſaid end, was very offenſive to God: ſecondly, that they were ſo farre gone in this tranſcendent miſchiefe, as no ordinary meanes could reſtraine their deſired pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and therefore God reſolves upon an extraordinary meanes to divert them: For, ſaith the ſacred Trinity, <hi>Goe to, let us goe downe, and there confound their language, that they may not underſtand one another,</hi> and this did effect it; For ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Jehovah <hi>ſcattered them from thence abroad upon the face of all the earth, and they left off to build the City, therefore is the name if it called Babel, becauſe</hi> Jehovah <hi>there confounded the language of all the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the tenth Chapter <hi>Moſes</hi> relates in what parts of the world theſe ſcattered families did firſt ſettle, and then concludes, ſaying, Theſe are the Families of the ſonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> after their generations in their Nations, and by theſe were the Nations divided after the flood.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the firſt part of the time of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall proceedings to mankind, from which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent premiſſes obſerve theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt from whence all heatheniſh <hi>Paganiſme</hi> or <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> did originally ſpring, namely, from Gods juſt puniſhmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of this peoples univerſall Apoſtaſie from the Pillar of truth,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:156664:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Oracle of life and glory, deſcending ſo famouſly to them by tradition from <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Noah,</hi> and renewed to them by Covenant from God; therefore for this univerſall apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, hee left them univerſally to walke in the vanity of their owne mindes, as without God in the world, about eighteene hundred yeeres.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve that for mans turning from God in this object of Juſtification; therefore the ſacred Oracle was three times confin'd to narrow bounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when <hi>Caine</hi> had killed <hi>Abel,</hi> then it was confined to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> and ſo downe to the Families of the ten firſt Fathers before the flood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, then confin'd in the Arke to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, when God drowned all the off-ſpring of the ten Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, together with <hi>Caines</hi> Poſterity, being partakers in apoſtaſy from truth to lying vanities; ſo by puniſhment in wofull miſeries.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, confin'd now at <hi>Babel,</hi> when God caſt off all the Nations for caſting away him in his truth and ſpeciall mercies, then was the object of life and glory confin'd to the Family of <hi>Shem,</hi> impleyed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. from the 10. verſe to the end of the Chapter, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> recording <hi>Shems</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie in the Booke of Life, and none elſe, mentioning their births, their dayes of life and their particular deaths.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, obſerve how that righteous <hi>Noah</hi> lived, and ſaw the apoſtaſie of the old world, and their puniſhment; his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> own off-ſprings apoſtaſie at <hi>Babel,</hi> and their puniſhment, the apoſtaſie of <hi>Shems</hi> Family, and ſo left this world, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily languiſhing ſo farre, as worſhipping the Idol Gods of the Heathen, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24.23. And ſaith <hi>Broughton,</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Scripture, <hi>Noah</hi> died but two yeeres before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was borne; therefore hee lived to ſee all this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerve, that notwithſtanding all theſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies, yet by tradition God upheld the Oracle of life in the world to this time; For <hi>Shem</hi> now perſonally continued conſtant in the truth, figuratively, perſonating Chriſt as King of Peace and Prieſt of the moſt high God, after the power of an endleſſe life, although man unbelieving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends downe to endleſſe death.</p>
               <p>Therefore Gods proceedings in this firſt part of time was to all mankinde alike without reſpect of perſons: as hee originally ſaid to <hi>Caine,</hi> If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not

               <p>Alſo when the Apoſtle called theſe Gentiles according to Gods purpoſe, about 18-hundred yeares after this Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, he then ſaith, <hi>thoſe whom he did foreknow, them he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conform'd to the Image of his Sonne, that he might be the firſt borne among many brethren.</hi>

               <p>And in the next verſe hee tells, the Gentiles <hi>God</hi> now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly had effected it, for he ſaith moreover, whom hee did predeſtinate, them alſo hee called, and whom he called them alſo he juſtified, and whom hee juſtified, them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30.</p>
               <p>And from this ground, the Apoſtle rightly concludes, that this promiſe of <hi>God</hi> to Abraham contained the Summe of the Goſpell concerning the Gentiles for ſaith hee the Scriptures,<note place="margin">All theſe Texts referrs Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny decree before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.</note> foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith, Preached before the Goſpell unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.</p>

               <p>Firſt hee gave him a Land.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from his own Loynes, a Nation great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to inherit that Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſeed from his own Bowells, in whom that Nation was to be heires intail'd to that Land for ever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Againe to the ſecond point, namely the gift of a great and glorious Nation, from his own Loynes to inherit this Land, as Chap. 13.16. <hi>I will make thy ſeed as the duſt of the Earth, So that if a man can number the duſt of the earth, then ſhall thy ſeed alſo be numbred,</hi> likewiſe Chap. 15. and 5. he brought him forth abroad and ſaid, <hi>looke up now towards Heaven, and tell the Starres, if thou be able to number them, and he ſaid unto him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe to the third point, namely the guift of the ſeed in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:156664:39"/> whom this glorious and great Nation ſhould be heires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd to this promiſed land forever: for when <hi>Abraham</hi> had thought that he ſhould be Childleſſe, and therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to make <hi>Eleazar</hi> his heire, to what God had given him, then <hi>Gen,</hi> 15.3. behold the word of <hi>Iehovah</hi> came to him ſaying, <hi>this ſhall not be thine heire, but he that ſhall come forth of thine owne bowells ſhall be thine Heire,</hi> and accordingly from him did ſpring this numberleſſe Nation to inherit this Promiſed Land in the right of the ſeed promiſed precedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Adam</hi> and now renewed to be the Sonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh by promiſe 430 yeares before the Law, as it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17 &amp; <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15. the Land was not in-tail'd by promiſe in the Plurall to ſeedes, but to thy ſeed for ever, meaning in Chriſt as figured in <hi>Iſaak</hi> the Child of Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore this Terreſtriall <hi>Canaan</hi> was intaild to them in Chriſt for an everlaſting inheritance, as it was a figure of the Caeleſtiall Canaan, yet eternall life intail'd with this proviſo, implicitly of their right ſubmittance in beliefe of truth, and ſo to enjoy this day of grace as a day of grace: and therefore at this univerſall Predeſtination in Chriſt, God gives this generall rule, <hi>I will bleſſe them that bleſse thee, and curſe them that curſe thee.</hi> That is, bleſſing more ſpeciall to them, which by beliefe of truth, rightly receive all good in the imputed righteouſneſſe of this ſeed, as did <hi>Abell,</hi> the firſt ten Fathers, and <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, or the contrary to them that beleeve not this truth, as to <hi>Cain,</hi> the old world, the Off-ſpring of <hi>Noah, Shems</hi> Poſterity and <hi>Terah Abrahams</hi> Father: So that Gods proceedings by this Covenant in the promiſed ſeed, was here layd downe without all reſpect of perſons, <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> both being comprehended in this Covenant.</p>
               <p>Againe to goe on, for in the rayſing of this Nation from miſery to mercy in Chriſt Jeſus, God expreſt himſelfe in divers figures, as firſt in the manner of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> conception and birth, he being the Child of promiſe, therefore that God might by this figure lead this Nation by a ſtreight line, to receive by beliefe of truth this land, as their terreſtriall day of grace, and to receive by Faith in Chriſts righteouſneſſe, the celeſtiall day of glory; therefore hee gave the naturall being of this Nation, not ſo much from the force of nature, as from Faiths object, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall force in the fleſh, eſpecially <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe was now as good as dead to

               <p>Yet when <hi>Sarah</hi> would caſt out <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> from inheriting this honour with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> this to <hi>Abraham</hi> was grievous, then ſaid God to <hi>Abraham, let it not be grievous in thy ſight, becauſe of the Lad, and becauſe of the bond-woman: In all that Sarah hath ſaid unto thee, hearken to her voyce: for in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> that is, figuratively in him to Chriſt by this ſtreight line, to receive the riches of mercy only in him, in whoſe righteouſneſſe imputed, I received all upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as now by Reſtauration, I intend to receive all, wherefore <hi>Abraham</hi> accordingly in this righteouſneſſe received the riches of grace to him and the whole world, <hi>and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe</hi>) as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.11.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6.</p>
               <p>And hereupon God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſion as the Seale of the righteouſneſſe imputed in the object of Faith, which he received by beliefe of truth, and then God gave this rule, that that man or Family which refuſed to receiue this Seale of righteouſneſſe, which is by Faith, ſhould be cut off from the nationall ſpouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.14. implying Gods impartiall proceedings towards them, as precedently to <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? if thou doſt not well ſinne lies at the dore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, to goe on with this elect Nation, and then we meete with another remarkeable figure, when <hi>Rebecca</hi> alſo had conceived twinns by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God then conſidered theſe two babes in her wombe, as two Nations and two manner
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:156664:40"/> of people to be ſeparated from her bowells, for ſo to <hi>Rebecca</hi> God explaines himſelfe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And becauſe God by tradition intended to leade this Nation by this figure, as by a ſtreight line of truth, to know in future times, that that riſe from their Idolatrous denne, to this honour in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loynes, was with no reſpect to <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon more then to any other mans, but onely to Gods mercifull election, as before is deſcribed: therefore before the Babes were borne, God elected the youngeſt Babe and his poſterity to this honour, but hee rejected from this honour the eldeſt babe and his poſterity, although he was the firſt-borne in the naturall line, as hateing this Elect Nations riſe to this mercy, with any reſpect to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> or <hi>Iacobs</hi> fleſhly line, as any cauſe moving him ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>Therefore he did this, that the purpoſe of God, according to the Election might ſtand only, according to his call of <hi>Abraham</hi> from an Idolatrous denne by mercy from that miſery.</p>
               <p>Againe, this Election and rejection of theſe babes and their poſterity, was before the babes were borne, as here we ſee, and therefore as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, it was before they had done good or evill,</hi> and ſo this figure told this Nation, that as their evill works in <hi>Terah</hi> (from whom in <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh they came) did not hinder God from ſhewing mercy to them being miſerable, ſo neither on the contrary, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good<note n="(a)" place="margin">As not workes ſo not faith fore-ſeen in <hi>Abraham</hi> or any other, is any ground of Gods election of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man to life and glory, but onely Gods love to himſelfe in the glory of his free grace in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is the ground of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as when God elected all mankind from reprobate divels, we being the ſame with them in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſo alſo the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time when he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the promiſed ſeed by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when they were all gone out of the way of peace, &amp; became abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by their Apoſtacy from that grace, as in this <hi>Chap.</hi> doth appeare.</note> works of <hi>Abrahams</hi> or theirs foreſeene, further or bring on this honourable election, to temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore that the purpoſe of God might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Iacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> Gen. 25.22, 23. Malach. 1.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thus to this Nation God ſet up <hi>Abraham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> perſons for three pillars, to preach through future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that not with reſpect to their perſons more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but only in his guift of the ſeed of the womans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe imputed to them, he raiſed them from an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous brood, periſhing in the examplary conciſion of their Anceſtors corruptions, to be Chriſts Nationall Spouſe elect: See <hi>pag.</hi> 72, 73.</p>
               <p>Againe, to diſcend with this Nation, we finde them then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:156664:41"/> in <hi>Egypt</hi> under great opreſſions by the cruelty of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but from thence with a high hand God delivers them, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the blood-ſhed of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Paſchall lambe lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thereby to Chriſt, his acceptable righteouſneſſe imputed by God to them, as the only ground of removing their deſerved miſeries, conferring upon them undeſerved mercies as he promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this promiſed ſeed, about 400 yeares before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.13 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13.</p>
               <p>And ſo God leades them from <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with his high hand of providence, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land, the figure of eternall felicity; for ſaith God to them, <hi>You have ſeene what I did unto the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and how I bare you on Eagles wings, and brought you unto my ſelfe.</hi> Exo. 19.</p>
               <p>Yet to God by beliefe of his truth in the promiſed ſeed, ſo famous by tradition deſcending to them from <hi>Adam,</hi> by the ten Fathers before the Flood down to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom he renewed this mercy for them; they nevertheleſſe by remiſſeneſſe, paſſed over all this, preferring the Onyons and fleſh-pots, and pleaſurable treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before the riches of the promiſed land, their day of grace, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Gods gift of their eternall glory in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> for when God tried them, their mindes were but fleſh, that is, onely agreeable to ſenſuall objects, as the bruit and no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: For neither reaſon nor Faith of Gods gift in Chriſt was of any uſe, wherefore God ſware, <hi>they ſhould never enter the figure of eternall reſt:</hi> implying, his impartiall proceedings to them as to <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, yet becauſe of their remiſſeneſſe (they being thus habituated to tranſgreſſe the oracle of life and glory, in the promiſed ſeed) therefore to the promiſe, God added the law in holy writ, to convey through their generations, this object of Faith more firmly, that ſo they might eate the ſame Spirituall meate, and drinke the ſame Spirituall drink, in right beliefe of truth, as did all that liv'd by Faith before them, and as doe all that now live in right beliefe of truth after them: for the fleſh of the Sacrifice which they did eate at their Feaſts; alſo the fleſh of the Paſchall lambe, was the fleſh of Chriſt to them in a figure, therefore in beliefe of truth in that figure, they did or might eate the fleſh of Chriſt, as now believing man doth Sacramentally, in bread and wine, and ſo to them: <hi>Chriſts</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the ſacrificing Prieſt-hood with the Leviticall Ordinances, as ſucceſſively continued unto them, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively led them to Gods gift of Chriſts ſatisfactory righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe imputed, and received by beliefe of truth, was it onely that cleanſed from all ſinne: that is, the guilt, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and the prevalencie of it, in Terreſtriall <hi>Canaan,</hi> and from the inherencie of ſinne in <hi>Canaan</hi> Celeſtiall.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, God made this <hi>Arke</hi> his Seat of mercy, in which being wrapt up both the Tables, and ſo entermingled, and from thence by <hi>Moſes</hi> hee ſpake to them: this figuratively ſchool'd this Spouſe to two things; firſt, that on theſe two Tables (as in the perfection of Chriſts workes) did hang all the Law and Prophets, that is, all the Lawes, prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Propheticall ſignifications: ſecondly, becauſe from this glorious Oracle, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (the Mediator in the Type) God ſpake to this Spouſe of Chriſt; this implicitly told her, that by her applying her ſelfe to this ſacred Oracle, that thence in Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed, God will ſo ſpeake peace to her through all generations, as to the <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> Exod. 25.20, 21, 22.

               <p>Yet hee implies that theſe glorious priviledges did not make him ſo conceive of them, as if Gods Word of curſe, according to his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> had taken none effect upon them to their rejection; for ſaith hee, <hi>all are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> implying, all are not of Iſraels faith that are of Iſraels fleſh; conſequently Gods Word of curſe, might be of force to them which refuſe Chriſt, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, notwithſtanding their precedent election.</p>

               <p>For in Scriptures we finde ſome that were rejected from inheriting this election to life and glory with the promiſed childe, as well as <hi>Eſau,</hi> and yet we find them admitted, and counted with the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely, Chriſts; as for example:</p>
               <p>In the Eſterne Countries, whither <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his ſons which he had by <hi>Keturah,</hi> and gave them portions, and ſent them thither purpoſely, that they might not inherit this election with the childe of promiſe <hi>Iſaack, Gen.</hi> 25.6. yet there we find juſt <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> who was deſcended from <hi>Eſau's</hi> loynes, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.35.36.

               <p>Therefore, if one of <hi>Eſau's</hi> off-ſpring, who in his loynes was rejected from this election, as were others, as here we ſee, and notwitſtanding that rejection were true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers in the acceptable righteouſneſſe of the ſeed: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much more might <hi>Eſau</hi> himſelfe: <hi>therefore let no man be prophane, as was</hi> Eſau, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.16.

So then it is not in him that willeth to have it from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, nor in him that runneth, to have it from the wrath of his erroneous works to the Law, but in God that ſheweth mercy in this election of you from your Idolatrous denne, to give you the Land of promiſe your day of grace, and his gift of eternall glory, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by you in beliefe of truth; and not for works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant onely about the object of faith, and under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thereof to extinguiſh the glorious workes of Chriſt, as now you doe.</p>

               <p>In what can you charge God of injuſtice; or excuſe your ſelves? as to ſay: <hi>Why haſt thou made me thus to honour or diſhonour?</hi> But God may juſtly ſay to you, Thy ſalvation is of me, but thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, O Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Againe, verſe 25. as God ſaith there, <hi>I will call them my people, which are not my people, and her beloved, which was not beloved, and it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where is was ſaid unto them, You are not my people, they ſhall be called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the living God:</hi> The Apoſtle citing their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet againſt them, implicitly refels their precedent errors in divers reſpects; as firſt, becauſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed of <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet were to be children to the living God.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:156664:46"/>
               <p>This therefore proved that <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall line after the fleſh, was not Gods ground of electing Children unto him, but the election muſt be in Chriſt as before.</p>
               <p>Againe, becauſe theſe Gentiles were to be Children of God which had not <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to obey, no not ſo much as in works converſant about the object of faith, and yet were to be Children unto God, conſequently their works of righteouſnes to the Law, was no ground of their Election but the election was of him that called them from their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous denne, and gave them the election in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Apoſtle cites the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> againſt them, ſaying, <hi>though the number of the Children of Iſrael be as the ſand on the Seaſhore, but a remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And becauſe the Apoſtle referres ſalvation but to a <hi>remnant,</hi> conſequently their diſcent from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, was no ground of their election; for if ſo, then not a <hi>remnant</hi> but all <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt have bin ſaved, but being referred to a <hi>remnant,</hi> therefore the election muſt be as before.</p>
               <p>And ſaith the Apoſtle, the ſame Prophet, ſaith, God will make a ſhort cut in righteouſneſſe, and <hi>except God had left a remnant, they had bin as Sodome, and like unto Gomorrah,</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods impartiall proceedings (ordinarily) with this elect ſpouſe of Chriſt, as betweene <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Caine,</hi> and as to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Covenant for curſednes and bleſſedneſſe. Therefore to this elect Spouſe God was no reſpecter of perſons.</p>
               <p>Againe, Verſe 30. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What ſhall wee ſay then; that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which followed not after righteouſneſſe, have attained to righteouſneſſe, even the righteouſneſſe which is of faith?</hi> by force of Gods precedent predeſtination with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for that's implyed: <hi>but</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>hath not attained the Law of righteouſneſſe;</hi> and then hee gives the prime reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe <hi>they ſought it not by faith, but, as it were, by workes of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he ſaith, <hi>they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Behold, I ſay in</hi> Sion <hi>a ſtumbling ſtone, and a rocke of offence, and whoſoever ſhall believe on him, ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> theſe words imply three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Iſraels glory (as Gods Iſrael) was grounded onely upon Chriſt, the Stone laid, as a pillar of truth on Sion hill.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:156664:46"/>
               <p>Secondly, that by remiſneſſe <hi>Iſraell</hi> fell to pride, and ſo from this ſtone to <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, and their own works of the law, to be the ground of all their glory, and ſo ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Pillar of truth, <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed,</hi> to their own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to thoſe of this Nation, that in right beliefe did ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of God that is, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſt imputed,</hi> the ground of all their glory, them God would uphold in honour; for ſaith the Text, <hi>hee that beleeveth, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>

               <p>So much for opening the ninth Chap. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> And here by the way obſerve, that this Chapter giveth no ground to Reverend <hi>Calvins</hi> error, namely, <hi>that God before the world was, did perſonally reprobate the greateſt part of mankinde to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable damnation, and perſonally elected the reſt to unavoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſalvation.</hi>

               <p>Againe, their election to inherit the Temporall felicity of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the figure of eternall felicity, could not be a debt due to the worth of their works, and to the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt too, for theſe are contraries, <hi>Wherefore</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if the election be by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace, but if it be by works, then it is no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke,</hi> Rom. 11.6.</p>
               <p>Againe, the worth of their works by the Law, did tend to overthrow the Foundation of the ſalvation of the world, becauſe it makes voyd the object of Juſtification, and alſo the uſe of Faith to that object in a juſtifying relation; and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if they of the Law be heires, Faith is made voyd, and the promiſe of none effect.</hi> Rom. 4.14.</p>

               <p>Againe, this conceited worth of works to the Law, put a nullitie to the Sonne of God, his glorious expiration of his life, for the completion of all righteouſneſſe, to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the world: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if righteouſneſſe come by the Law,</hi> (that is as they would have it) <hi>then Chriſt died in vaine.</hi> Gal. 2.21.</p>
               <p>Againe, he gives them to know, the Law is not of Faith, his meaning is, not to any living man on Earth, but only to Chriſt, as bound to believe and do the perfection of the Law in every tittle, as their Doctrine of works did import, for in this reſpect hee only and alone, is the man that could do them, and did live in them as a perfect man, to take off the curſedneſſe from all that believe his righteouſneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Againe, when Chriſt is manifeſted by the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, without the prefigurations of the Law, yet now this People would believe in Chriſt his righteouſneſſe for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but would then joyne their righteouſneſſe in the obedience of the Law to his, as neceſſary to their ſalvation, and by this they runne upon a two-fold Rock at once.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they binde themſelves to obſerve all the Laws, from which now by Chriſts perfect obedience they were freed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by this they made a nullitie to themſelves, of all happineſſe by Chriſt, as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that if yee be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, for I teſtify againe to every man that is Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that he is a debtor to doe the whole Law; Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, yee are farre fallen from Grace.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, as the Morall laws expiration is in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſo it is of a double uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are to receive by Faith the Morall laws perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in him, as given of God imputatively to juſtification, and ſo to receive the remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to apply our ſelves to it, as our rule of imitation in love to God and our Neighbour, and having done our beſt continually to ſubmit to his, as imputed for our continued acceptation here, and for eternall life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And the ground why the perfections of the Morall law onely in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> doth free man beleeving truth, from the law of ſinne and of death, ſo conveying to him eternall life by ſalvation, is this, becauſe the Morall law originally in its pure naturalls, was inſtituted by God, a meanes in the Covenant to a ſupernaturall end in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as is proved; wherefore no ſooner did the Morall law in Chriſt his ſacred perſon by his birth in the promiſe ſubſiſt in him, as the ſpotleſſe Lambe, but in that inſtant of time, it was ingaged in him being the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as a meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that ſupernaturall end by perfect love to God and his Neighbour; and therefore it was immediatly put upon all mankinde, freeing man from the law of ſinne and of death, becauſe it came upon all men to juſtification of life: for it removed <hi>Adams</hi> imputed damnation, which was to paſſe according to the juſtice of the Covenant, and ſo it removed the totall nature and prevalency of ſinne, and obtained the foreſaid diſpoſitions of Amity to God, and enmity to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:156664:48"/> as alſo the good of this world, to be mans day of grace, to receive in Gods gift, the day of eternall glory.</p>
               <p>Againe, I ſay it muſt be by beliefe of this truth, in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, or the object of Juſtification: And the ground why man capable of the uſe of reaſon, muſt receive all bleſſedneſſe by beliefe of this truth is:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe as Gods word of truth giving this object of life, is as Gods hand or inſtrument to reach this gift to man, ſo alſo man his beliefe of that truth, is as it were, mans hand or inſtrument, to receive this gift from God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be by beliefe of this truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt be by beliefe of this word of truth, as conveying the object of faith, becauſe man his reaſonable ſoule, is but a receiver into it ſelfe, all its ſupernaturall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity from externall objects believed, as in <hi>Adam</hi> we ſee, and therefore ſo in this object of juſtification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is by beliefe of this truth, becauſe the aforeſaid principles of derivative Amity which God put in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all men, doth internally diſpoſe them to this Amity with God, aſwell as to enmity to Satan: wherefore at firſt, God requireth man to come to him in beliefe of truth, but according to ſenſe and reaſon, as he doth excitively draw out that Principle, ſo to give mans reaſonable ſoule a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internall power to receive his gift of Chriſt, namely, a power to believe divine teſtimony, as divine teſtimony; that is, to receive it from God as from God, for as God ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not where he ſtrewes not, ſo he gives this power to man that had it not, to receive his gift of Chriſt, the ground of all his happineſſe: Wherefore becauſe this Elect Spouſe, did not ſo applie her received Talents, to receive more Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in Gods way, to receive life in Chriſt the object of Faith, but contrarily applied Gods talents and his law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in his own way, to have all their own way, namely, from terreſtriall felicity, and from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, and from the worth of their owne workes, at beſt, but converſant about the object of <hi>Faith,</hi> and no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Faith in that object: therefore God rejected this elect Spouſe, to the remarkable praiſe of his juſtice in all the world, ſixteene hundred yeares and more; therefore he reſpects no mans perſon, but according to his firſt Modell, <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? if thou doſt not well ſinne lies at the dore.</hi>

               <p>But the fact of the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the death of Chriſt was a moſt wrongfull nay-ſay to God, in all they did, and therefore ſaith Chriſt to them, <hi>Iob.</hi> 8.40. this did not <hi>Abraham,</hi> preſenting implicitly to their remembrance <hi>Abrahams</hi> Typicall fact in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſlew <hi>Iſaack</hi> really in his intention, ſo might they intend and accompliſh his death in the truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did love him whom he really ſlew in his intention, ſo much more ought they to love him in his death, as the moſt proper child of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as <hi>Abraham</hi> never intended nor attempted to ſlay the promiſed ſeed, untill there came an extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to doe, ſo neither ought they much more in this fact of the death of Chriſt.<note place="margin">So it is one thing to do that which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be done by them, and another thing to doe that thing as God would have them to do it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, but when that commandement came, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in reſpect of their love to him they had beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, yet in reſpect of their faith and love to God in this Myſterie, they ſhould have beene obediently willing to kill him, as God ſhould preſcribe the manner, as to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> he did for God in <hi>Abrahams</hi> typicall fact, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to confirme their faith, that Chriſt the ſeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould by the expiration of his life, aſpire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of all righteouſneſſe, for the redemption of this world; but alſo to teach them how to demeane themſelves in the manner of Chriſts death, in a harmeleſſe nay-ſay to God as did <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father.</p>
               <p>The Negative precept of the Morall Law, forbidding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> murther, ſtood as their ſtanding law to keepe them from all unjuſt taking away any innocent mans life, much more not to take away the life of him, which at leaſt appeared to them a man ſent from God.</p>

               <p>Therefore it muſt needs follow by undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that their firſt ſtep to this ungodly neceſſity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from their owne remiſſeneſſe to God in all his wayes for their good; for had they conſidered theſe things, they would never have deſtroyed him, by whom all felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty came to them.</p>
               <p>And then their remiſſeneſſe to that object of faith Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall, brought on their inordinate intenſneſſe to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall objects terreſtriall, and to Idolatrous imaginations, and ſo came on their ſecond ſtep neceſſitating them to this tranſcendent fact,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſtep.</note> as for example: their remiſſeneſſe to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediator in the type, brought on their Calfe, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in things ſenſuall and terreſtriall, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their crucifying of Chriſt to themſelves, by abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their mindes from <hi>Moſes</hi> in that myſterie; for they then not onely worſhiped the Calfe, but alſo they did eate and drinke, and roſe up to play:</p>

                  </note>Likewiſe our Saviour gives another cloſe glance to this point, ſpeaking of this elect Nation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24, 22. hee ſaith, <hi>the daies of their vengeance ſhall be ſhortened in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Ieruſalem, for the elects ſake:</hi> Implying, elſe no fleſh of

               <p>And in the next verſe hee gives a demonſtrative reaſon thereof in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who although by their precedent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie were ſo long rejected, yet now God gave Chriſt to them, and calls them to him. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. Thereby implying likewiſe, God would not repent his gift of Chriſt to this Spouſe, and therefore call them to him againe.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is moſt cleere, that Gods proceeding in this ſecond part of time, is without all reſpect of Perſons.</p>
               <p>And for a concluſion of this Chapter, take theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that to referre any mans faith and obedience to bee the condition of the Covenant of grace, but Chriſt his faith and obedience, is to derrogate from him and to arrogate to man that which is not his.</p>
               <p>Becauſe as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> his ſecond eſtate before his fall, was an eſtate of Faith and obedience active and paſſive, the ſomme of the conditions of the Covenant as precedently is proved Chapt. the 2.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Sonne of God the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience paſſive and active, was an eſtate of Faith, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant for the Redemption of the world, from whence the Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was changed by him, from a Covenant of wrathfull juſtice, to a Covenant of Grace and mercy to all the world as Chap. 4.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in this Chapter we ſee hee and hee alone was the man, which by ſaith and love to God and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, did live in the pure naturalls of the Law to every tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to redeeme man which by Apoſtaſie brought himſelfe under the Curſe.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:156664:52"/>
               <p>For although the life of all believers, beſides <hi>Chriſts</hi> is in this world an eſtate of faith and obedience, and although Gods word of truth is his inſtrument to give to man <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe, and mans faith his inſtrument to receive in that righteouſneſſe his bleſſedneſſe, yet between God and mankind, neither of theſe are the conditions of the covenant of grace: For as God on his part hath not bound himſelfe to either of theſe as a condition, ſo neither hath he bound all mankinde abſolutely to believe or not to be ſaved: For if faith were the condition of the Covenant of Grace, God in juſtice could not ſave one of mankinde which did not believe.</p>
               <p>But it is already proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. that an innumerable number of mankinde departing this world in Infancie, childhood, or the like, by the univerſall grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Chriſt Jeſus <hi>our Saviour,</hi> are ſaved: Likewiſe ſo was all mankind without faith ſaved from the damnation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to the praiſe of Gods grace to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Therefore, although to man capable of the uſe of reaſon, faith<note n="*" place="margin">It is one thing that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and another that hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it as a condition of the Covenant.</note> is the neceſſary inſtrument as his mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his meat, and muſt be applyed to the object of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in ſome degree, or hee muſt periſh, yet his faith and obedience is no condition of the Covenant of grace, no more then mans mouth whereby hee receives his meate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo, that as firſt upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in the promiſed ſeed with <hi>Abraham</hi> by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God elected, predeſtinated, and fore-appointed all mankinde alike from periſhing in miſery to grace and glory in Chriſt Jeſus, as here wee ſee.</p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, what is Gods moſt proper booke of life, namely, the promiſed ſeed; for in him all mankinde were both times onely written for grace and glory, as in a booke of life, not onely when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, but the ſecond time, as is regiſtred by covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to life and glory, therefore <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is Gods moſt proper Booke of life, out of which all that periſh are blotted out for deſpiſing this gift of grace and glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 12, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it ſo, that although at one and the ſame time, God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> by covenant thus predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to glory, yet called not the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:156664:52"/> till about eighteene hundred yeeres after, but called the <hi>Iewes</hi> to inherit this glory in the birth of <hi>Iſaack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve the onely ground, why the <hi>Iewes</hi> were firſt in this honour in reſpect of time was, becauſe God for his owne names ſake was pleaſed then to begin the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that bleſſed predeſtination; and from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his ground, <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them the priority, commanding the twelve, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>goe not into the way of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and into any of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the</hi> Samaritans <hi>enter yee not, but goe yee rather unto the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. Likewiſe at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> rendred the ſame priority to them, ſaying, <hi>It was neceſſary the Word of God ſhould firſt have beene ſpoken unto you,</hi> Acts 13.46, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the expiration of all righteouſneſſe upon the croſſe, had made open the way to bring in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo making both one generall aſſembly and Church of the firſt borne inroll'd in heaven, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p>Yet our Saviour in a Parable foretelling the <hi>Iewes</hi> of this joyning the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to them, implies his proceeding in this generall aſſembly, ſhall be without all reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, chooſing and refuſing, as betweene <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> for hee concludes his diſcourſe, ſaying, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> Matth. 10.14.</p>
               <p>Further, implying, notwithſtanding the extraordinary fluxe of grace and truth, which was then to be powred out upon all fleſh; yet if they did not apply themſelves therein, to receive his righteouſneſſe imputed to be their wedding garment for acceptance, they ſhould not be reſpected.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, is it ſo, that the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is the alone condition of the covenant of grace, which by mercy brought eternall life to all mankind alike.</p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, that the fruition of that eternall life in Heaven, is to all alike without degree of glory to one more then another, although here the degrees of grace are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſome more, and ſome leſſe, as they apply more or leſſe their talents to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the object of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Yet the fruition of that glory depends onely and alone on <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteous workes, which is mans by free gift; therefore that glory is enjoyed there by al alike, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>(Chriſt onely excepted)</hi> who in all things muſt have the preheminence; for one mans reaſonable ſoule is not more uncapable then anothers in it's eſſentiall faculty ſimply
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:156664:53"/> conſidered, but all the difference of capacities ariſeth from error, tranſgreſſion and ſinne, or the effects of ſinne: but in the fruition of that glory, all this for <hi>Chriſts</hi> his righteouſneſſe ſake is removed, and not remaining conſequently their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities being then alike, their enjoyment of that glory is all alike, without degrees, to the praiſe of Gods grace to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not ſo, on the contrary, to mankinde in eternall death, becauſe their ſinne abides upon them, ſo that they deſcend to eternall death, not for anothers workes, as men aſcend to eternall life; but for their owne deſpiſing Gods grace leading to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as they more or leſſe were in ſinne, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Juſtice requires more or leſſe puniſhment for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing eternall felicity Gods way.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, obſerve it ſtands all mankind hereupon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of remiſſeneſſe to God in his way by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> for their eternall felicity; for as wee all in <hi>Adam</hi> by remiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Gods Covenant, fell ſo low in miſery, as never any meere creature could raiſe us from thence, as <hi>Chapter</hi> 3. Likewiſe, in this laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> wee ſee <hi>Chriſts</hi> elect Spouſe, by her remiſſeneſſe to her felicity by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> brought upon her ſelfe a connexion of cauſes, neceſſitating her ſelfe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable rejection from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a fugitive remarkeably deſpicable here on earth, this ſixteene hundred yeeres and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Is it ſo, that the Law was added becauſe the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Abraham</hi> did tranſgreſſe the object of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given in the promiſed ſeed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed to them with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, how rightly ſpeakes the Apoſtle, that the Law was not given to the righteous man, that is, as unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> who terminated his operations by beliefe of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to God and man, by a right relation to God in the object of Juſtification; for here in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> wee ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> law added to the Promiſe, to ſchoole <hi>Abrahams</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe off-ſpring to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they precedntly tranſgreſſe the promiſe.</p>

               <p>Againe, all the time that they were under wrath, yet God intermingled his wrath with mercy, leaving them a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way to eternall life, by ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the narrowneſſe of this way is to be conſidered in a two-fold reſpect, namely, in meanes internall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>The internall meanes was the remainders of the aforeſaid infuſed principle, hereditarily deſcending in the Nature of man, which as it diſpoſed them to Enmity with Satan, ſo alſo to Amity with God, from whence, although they had not the Oracle of God to direct them, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly grants ſome few of them did attaine Circumciſion of the heart, virtually at leaſt in their obedient ſeeking of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.

               <p>Againe ſaith hee, <hi>if the uncircumciſion keepe the righteouſneſſe of the law; ſhall not his uncircumciſion be counted circumciſion?</hi> and ſaith hee, <hi>ſhall not uncircumciſion which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 26.27. And he then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Point in the behalfe of the vertues of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, in oppoſing the proud formalitie of the profeſſion in the Law by the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſaying <hi>he is not a Iew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he is a Iew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion which is of the Heart in the ſpirit, and, not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the ground why the Apoſtle eſteemes theſe vertues by Nature amongſt the Heathens, to be the circumciſion of the heart, is this, becauſe it did implicitly and vertually leade the hearts of theſe Heathens to God in Jeſus Chriſt and the ground why it did ſo is this.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the foreſaid principles of Enmity and Amity was derivatively put into their hearts, iſſuing from Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, for it was given in the promiſe of Chriſt, when God ſaid, <hi>I will put enmity, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore if it be by man, put forth to ſeeke for God, as God extitively drawes it out, but in natures voyce, it will implicitly and virtually at leaſt move to God in the wrath of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, imputed under the Notion of mercy, for according to the nature of a thing, ſuch is its operation.</p>
               <p>But here in Chriſt wee ſee, was its roote, therefore the cicumciſion of the heart, was its fruite. So much for the internall meanes in this narrow way to eternall life by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the externall meanes of this narrow way to life, was twofold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the oracle or pillar of Truth, as included in <hi>Iſraels</hi> common-wealth, for by this God did as it were, reach forth his helping hand of mercy to theſe miſerable <hi>Gentiles</hi> under wroth: for at firſt when God gave the Law of Circumciſion, he then gave a Law of admittance, not of Circumciſion to goe out among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but for <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> and ſtrangers to come to <hi>Abrahams</hi>

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:156664:55"/>
               <p>And here by Gods Law they might receive the ſeale of righteouſneſſe, which is by Faith: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, about foure hundred yeares after this, when God reared up the Moſaicall Ordinances, a partition wall, by hand-writing upon Record, differencing the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Gentiles more excluſively then ever before, and the Jewes more incluſively to the Oracle of life: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9, 10. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the 16. Yet then alſo God made a Law of admittance for Heathens and ſtrangers, to Sojourne in <hi>Iſraels</hi> Common-wealth, and gave them the ſame Rule to come to him in the ſatisfactory righteouſneſſe of the promiſed ſeed, as he did to his elect Spouſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.33, 34. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.15.

               <p>So much for the firſt externall meanes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond externall meanes was more univerſall even to all the Families of the Earth, namely, <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking kindly in the voyce of the Creatures, to them in Jeſus Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly; for from <hi>God</hi> his Covenant in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> firſt in the Promiſed ſeed with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſecondly renew'd with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> hee gave all mankinde the fruitfull Seaſons, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating unto them food and gladneſſe, ſo by a good Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall, drawing them by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> implicitly, to looke up for a good Celeſtiall in him.</p>

               <p>And the ground why <hi>Gods</hi> voyce in the creatures, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citively draw unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the diſtilled influence of his Spirit, as the dew to the tender hearbe, is this becauſe the whole creation, is as it were, wrapt in the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as in a mantle of mercy, for from thence it came to paſſe, that this world is as now it is, mans day of grace, to receive the gift of eternall glory, and therefore as thy tender mercies oh Lord are over all thy works, ſo doſt thou by thy kindneſſe therein excitively draw man to thee in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the hope of glory. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 27.</p>
               <p>And from this ground the Apoſtle brings in <hi>Gods</hi> voyce in the creatures, joyntly cooperating with Gods voyce in the Goſpell, begetting Faith in the heart of man: ſo then ſaith hee, <hi>Faith cometh by heareing, and heareing by the word of God;</hi> but I ſay, have they not heard? yes ſaid he, ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:156664:56"/>
               <p>And the ground of this point is implyed in the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> and 28. <hi>verſe,</hi> from the rule of contraries, hee ſpeaking of ſome of theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which did withhold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, ſaith, even as they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge, ſo God gave them up to a reprobate minde, to doe things not convenient, being filled with all unrighteouſneſſe, implying on the contrary, that if they had carefully retained God in their knowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth which they had received of him, that then God in mercy would have kept them from the power of their ſinnes in this narrow way to life; for before the Apoſtle ſaith, God would render to them eternall life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Law, as well as to the <hi>Iew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore this meanes was efficacious in this narrow way to eternall life to ſome, and might have beene to more of theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> under wrath: for the Apoſtle having thus proved, that the uncircumciſed <hi>Gentiles</hi> doing by nature the things contained in the Oracle of God, might attaine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as well as the nationall Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that from hence they would imagine, that hee made no difference betweene them and the uncircumciſed <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> therefore in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> ſaith hee, What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage then hath the <hi>Iew,</hi> or what profit is there of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that is, of all their peculiar and glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges?

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Being an Introduction to the third part of time in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called to life and glory.</head>
               <p>I Call it an Introduction, becauſe, as Chriſt being ſlaine figuratively in the Lambe, in the point of time that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, his righteouſneſſe being committed or imputed to to the world then made way for all bleſſedneſſe to man: So now alſo being ſlaine in the truth and finiſhed all righteouſneſſe, it being in mercy imputed to the world this ſecond time, it then brake downe the partition wall of the <hi>Moyſaicall</hi> Ordinances, which before excluded the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and ſo made an open way to bring in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit with the <hi>Iewes</hi> the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is requiſite I ſhould now firſt ſhow how the Sonne of God did this great worke of reſtoring the world and ſo come to ſhew the calling of the Gentiles to that bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:156664:58"/>
               <p>And firſt take notice that God not only led <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, and Chriſts elect Spouſe to Eternall felicity by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, but alſo Chriſt himſelfe: For as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was by God aſſign'd his place, for the improvement of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Excellencies, to Gods glory, for the Supernaturall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the World, namely the Garden of Eden, with its prefigurations: So likewiſe the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by God, for the Improvement of his perfect excellencies, to the ſaid end had his place aſſign'd him, namely the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> figured firſt by Gods aſſigning the particular Place where <hi>Iſaack</hi> the promiſed ſeed in the Type was to be Sacrificed, that is, onely in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> which God appointed <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It was likewiſe prefigured in this, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was entail'd to <hi>Iſaack</hi> the promiſed Seed in the Tipe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Intaile deſcended figuratively to Chriſt as he was the Sonne of King <hi>David,</hi> therefore the breadth of this Land, is thy Land O <hi>Emanuel,</hi> as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this was likewiſe Typified to Chriſt, in that all Sacrifices in the Type, were excluded from all places in the world, and included only in this Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> neere the Temple, reſtrictively to expire their lives in the Type: Therefore in this Land, was the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in the truth, Perſonally to performe the worke of the redemption of the world, the which accordingly hee did.</p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſt the Sonne of God, as he was man, was borne under five relations to this worke.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by promiſe, the Sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the ſeed of the woman, immediatly upon the fall, and therefore bound by the Law of Nature to relieve his Parents in their Lapſed condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by promiſe borne the Sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore bound to the Law of circumciſion, figuring his cutting off the powers of Satan, that is, of ſinne and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof; for the Covenant was, that all the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be circumciſ'd in their generations: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was borne in ſubjection to that Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee was by promiſe borne the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> therefore borne under the Law of the Typicall Mediator, as added to the law of circumciſion; therefore bound to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:156664:58"/> love God with al his heart, &amp; al his ſtrength &amp; his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf, in the work of the redemption of the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> ſo hereditarily to the crowne of the Terreſtriall <hi>Canaan,</hi> figuratively leading him by Faith to his eternall Throne in the Celeſtiall <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, at laſt all theſe relations meet in one iſſue by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother: for when the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, made under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sonnes, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he was the Sonne of God alſo, by eternall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſecond perſon in the ſacred Trinity, and ſo perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally God man, and therefore bound to the fulfilling of all the law and the Prophets, to the regaining of Gods glory by reſtauration of the world by redemption, as it was ſaid, <hi>it ſhall breake thy head,</hi> the truth is, and ſo he did; for as we firſt in <hi>Adam</hi> magnified Satans lies for truths, and nullified Gods truth for lyes, ſo likewiſe at that time when hee came to this worke, all the world,<note place="margin">This definition is an anſwere to <hi>Pilates</hi> Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.

               <p>Likewiſe he being in the Synagogue, intermingling this Doctrine of truth with another miraculous fact, called to a woman bound by Satan eighteene yeares, and by the word of his mouth makes her free from the bondage of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan implicitly telling them, that if by the call of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they would (in beliefe of that truth) but as they were able by ſenſe and reaſon come to him, he then would diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolve the power of ſatan in them, and ſo the truth ſhould make them free; but the lying ſpirit of ſatan in the Ruler of the Synagogue, reſiſted this truth, for he anſwereth with indignation becauſe that Ieſus had healed on the ſabbath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:156664:60"/> day and ſaid unto the people, are there not ſix days in which men ought to worke in them? therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>But this evill ſpirit ſo changed into an Angell of light, the Lord diſcovers and ſaid, <hi>Thou Hypocrite, doth not each of you on the Sabboth day looſe his Oxe or his Aſſe from the ſtall, and leade him to the water? and ought not this woman, being a daughter of</hi> Abraham <hi>which Satan had bound,</hi> loe, eighteene yeeres, be looſed on the Sabbath day? and all his enemies were aſhamed: likewiſe hee miraculouſly fed many with ſmall parcells of bread, declaring himſelfe thereby, as by his doctrine, that hee was the bread of life to man by beliefe of this truth to nouriſh him to everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, by raiſing up the widowes ſonne and <hi>lairus</hi> daughter, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> foure dayes dead, declaring by this, as by his doctrine, that he was ſent of his Father to them, the reſurrection and life to man by their beliefe of truth in him.

               <p>Likewiſe, by a remarkeable fact he condemned the pride of the prieſts and others of this elect Spouſe in their proud apoſtaſie after the fleſh, couched under a pretence of the celeſtiall doctrine, the worſhip and the Temple; for the eternall Son of God rides upon an Aſſe in a contemptible manner into <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Metropolis of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſo deſpiſed the vanity of all that glory; yet this fact tended to the conſolation of the meeke in <hi>Sion,</hi> by beliefe of truth, as was fore-propheſied, <hi>behold, thy King commeth unto thee, meeke and ſitting on an Aſſe and a Colt, the foale of an Aſſe,</hi> and the common people and his Diſciples gave him high praiſe and glory, at which the proud apoſtate Prieſts, Scribes, and the like their hearts did riſe; for to him they ſaid.

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt witneſſed this truth hand to hand with Satan himſelfe; for, when hee had denyed himſelfe not the fruit of one tree, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to have done, but all food, forty dayes together, dedicating himſelfe to the great worke of the Redemption of the world in obedience to his Father: ſo mediating for mercy to the world, he afterwards was an hungry, then came Satan to him, and ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, command this ſtone that it be made bread,</hi> and Chriſt by the word of truth, repells his aſſault; For, <hi>Ieſus anſwered him, ſaying, It is written, That man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> implying; that as mans temporary life is maintained by an influence from God in bread, ſo his life ſpirituall here by faith, is in every word of God from the influence of his ſpirit: Likewiſe then the Divell taking him up into an high mountaine, ſhewed him all the Kingdomes of the world in a moment of time, and the Divell ſaid unto him, <hi>All this power will I give to thee, and the glory of them,</hi> for that is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will I give it; if thou therefore wilt fall downe before me all ſhall be thine. <hi>Ieſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, get thee behind me Satan,</hi> for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> implying, that himſelfe was perſonally God-man, and ought therefore to be worſhipped by him.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe he brought him to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſet him on a pinacle of the Temple, and ſaid unto him, <hi>if thou be the ſonne of God</hi> (as thy words import) <hi>then caſt thy ſelfe downe from hence;</hi> for it is written <hi>He ſhall give his Angells charge over thee to keepe thee, and in their hands they ſhall beare thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone; And Ieſus anſwering, ſaid unto him, it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying what he had ſaid before was his anſwer, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So that although the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> believed a lye to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all, yet the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was conſtant in Gods truth, diſſolving Satans lies for the reſtauration of all, and Satan, ſaith he hath nought in me.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe diſcovers to the world, what Satans opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was and is, for <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. he ſaith, <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ther thereof,</hi> verſe 44.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt now witneſſeth Gods truth againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:156664:62"/> lyes by faith and flames of love to God under Gods moſt dreadfull wrath, ſo offering himſelfe as a whole burnt offering to God, yet not but that Gods truth may be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed under divine juſtice and not under wrath; likewiſe under mercy, and not under wrath: Alſo under Juſtice in exceeding great wrath.</p>
               <p>The firſt was <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate in the Covenant before his fall.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Eſtate of the Saints witneſſing Gods truth in ſome conformity to Chriſt, in which reſpect hee which ſanctifieth, and they which are ſanctified are one, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>The third was the eſtate of Chriſt, as the Redeemer of the fallen world; for as hee was for our ſinnes in <hi>Adam,</hi> and for the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> apoſtaſie, a ſinner imputed; Hee therefore in this reſpect was a man as hated of God, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, reckoned amongſt the tranſgreſſors.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, ſo it was with him from his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the expiration of his life; for although his conception and birth was not in ſinne, but<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as do chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>viz.</hi> ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the womb, is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold pledge to us: firſt, that it was to deſtroy the workes of Satan in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after man believeth truth, to free him from the feare of death, to which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently all his life long hee was ſubject, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14.</note> conceived and borne an holy thing, the Sonne of God, yet his conception and birth was from her, in whom was ſinne, the ſeed of the Serpent; wherefore ſhee rejoyced in him as her Saviour and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe no ſooner was he borne but Satan in <hi>Herod</hi> attempted to bruiſe his heele: Likewiſe his breeding under his ſuppoſed father was but meane, a Carpenter: Likewiſe with his kindred, which nationally was his Spouſe, he was reputed but a meane fellow, a friend of Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a mad man, a conjurer, an impoſtor, a blaſphemer of God, a Divell.</p>
               <p>Therefore rightly doth the Apoſtle incourage the Saints to undergoe the hatred of the world, to conſider him that indured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelfe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.13.</p>
               <p>Againe, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by the juſtice of the Covenant in point of triall againſt Satans lyes, was eſtated not onely in the ſweet perfections of the glory of nature: but alſo in the ſplendor of the Garden relatively drawing him by faith to enjoy God in the heavenly glory; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> not onely under wrath, but under exceeding great wrath, as appeares in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his feares of the neere approach of that wrath.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:156664:63"/>
               <p>Secondly, by what it was when he was directly under it: firſt, when this houre and power of darkneſſe did draw neere, although it was a thing greatly by him deſired; as his aſpired end to his fathers glory; for when he commeth into the world, he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and offrings thou wouldſt not have, but a body haſt thou prepared mee: then ſaid I, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, I come to doe thy Will, O God,</hi> Luke 22.15. Heb 10. yet I ſay, the neer approach of this houre and power of darkneſſe was dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his apprehenſion, as appeares by his <hi>feares. ſorrow, prayer</hi> and <hi>cryes,</hi> who (as ſaith the Text) <hi>In the dayes of his fleſh, when hee had offered up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong cryes and teares to him that was able to ſave him from death, was pitied in the thing he feared;</hi> for there appeared unto him an Angell from heaven, yet not to take off his miſery, but to ſtrengthen him to it, and there was need ſo to doe; for his bones were ſundred in this agony his ſpirit waxed hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him as melted wax, and from thence it was that his ſweat became as great drops of blood falling down to the ground, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.41.</p>
               <p>But hee having reſolved in beliefe of truth by flaming love to goe on through the apprehenſion of its neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him, to approach to it in reſignation of his will to his Fathers Will, in the worlds redemption: Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded twice of his apprehenders, <hi>whom ſeeke yee?</hi> and affirmes himſelfe twice to be the man whom they ſought, and although they fel backwards before him, yet he goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with them, to encounter this dreadfull wrath which extended to a two-fold ſeparation of God from him:</p>
               <p>Firſt, God ſeparated himſelfe from him in all naturall good, either to ſoule or body, and left him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſeparated himſelfe from his ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in all ſupernaturall and celeſtiall good, and left him to the contrary evill; and firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p>To his body, and ſo to the anguiſh of his ſoule; for it was torne with whips, pierc'd with thornes, his hands and feet pierc'd with nayles, and riven or rent with the weight of his body hanging on the croſſe ſixe houres, or thereabouts: Likewiſe to coole his thirſt, they gave him vinegar and gall to drinke; the people and Prieſt blaſpheme him as a man forſaken of God, the whole powers of nature, as it were, riſing againſt him, extinguiſhing from him all things
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:156664:63"/> but dread and dolour, for darkneſſe from the ſixt houre to the ninth covered him; the Temple rent, the earth quak't, the Rocks rent, ſo that in reſpect of Gods ſeparating all naturall good from him, leaving him to the contrary evill, he might truly ſay in the dolor of his ſoule, <hi>All yee that paſſe by, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>rrow like unto my ſorrow which is done unto mee, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted mee in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> Lam. 1.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God likewiſe ſeparated himſelfe from him in all ſupernaturall and Celeſtiall good, and left him to the contrary evill, for becauſe this ſeparation of God from him in all naturall good, leaving him to the contrary evill, was in this place, namely the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> this implyed, that God alſo ſeparated himſelfe from him in all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall good, becauſe this Land in generall, was to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> as the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, a figure by the Terreſtriall good of the Celeſtiall good in the Heaven of Heavens.</p>
               <p>Therefore this figured to him, that God ſhut the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven againſt him, rendring him no light in that reſpect, but leaving his ſoule the only object of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe; this being at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the figure of eternall peace, this implyed to him, that no peace or conſolation at that time was his portion from God, but the contrary appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of eternall woe, ſutable to the damned Spirits of men and Divells.</p>
               <p>Againe, this being alſo in the place of reſidence of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Spouſe the Kingdome of grace on Earth, this imply'd that he was to God, a man cut off from the land of the living in all reſpects, conſequently no place left to him by divine juſtice, but the place prepared for the Divell and his Angels, for ſaith the text, <hi>he was reckoned amongſt the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Luk 22, 37.</p>
               <p>Therefore his cry upon the croſſe was according to truth, <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee;</hi> which words implyed two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this twofold Separation of God from him in his apprehenſion, was more dreadfull then he could reach in his humane comprehenſion and therefore cryed, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, his words further imply, that his ſeparation was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:156664:64"/> onely on Gods part, never on his; for he in this darkneſſe where was no light, and this depth where no humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could feele any bottome. yet hee kept union in faith, and flames of love to God and his Neighbour in a right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the worlds redemption, and therefore hee ſaid, <hi>My God my God,</hi> as never letting him goe: So raiſing his Soule from that depth of death under Gods flaming wrath by Faith and love, and ſo rendred his Soule to God from his body, and his body to duſt a whole burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaying, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was the firſt and great Reſurrection of the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in which hee raiſed himſelfe by his own power, from the depth of infernall death, yea the moſt certaine death, that is, death in the ſubſtance, as it was ſaid, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt, thou ſhalt certainely die the death:</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:156664:65"/> gave himſelfe alſo a ranſome for all men in the fourth eſtate of man to redeeme them from their Apoſtacie. And for concluſion to this Chapter, obſerve theſe five particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that when in common ſpeech we ſay, <hi>that Chriſt fulfilled the Law,</hi> we may rightly underſtand it only of the Morall Law, becauſe he by perfect love to God and his Neighbour, did fulfill all Lawes; that is, not only the Covenant as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo as upon theſe two did hang all the Law and the Prophets, with reſpect of mans fourth eſtate, as before is proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> raiſ'd his Soule<note n="(a)" place="margin">The firſt Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</note> by beliefe of truth and perfect love from that vaſt depth of death, and that that was his firſt and great reſurrection, as the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, that the raiſing of his body was his ſecond reſurrection, and moſt properly by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="(b)" place="margin">The ſecond Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</note>, and from Divine Juſtice his firſt ſtep to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe, for ſo great a worke as the redemption of the world. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. in this fourth eſtate of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it ſo, that the works of the Sonne of God was ſo potent in beliefe of truth to that bleſſedneſſe which was ſet before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. as that it wrought up to God from under ſo vaſt a ſeparation in flames of burning love to Gods glory by the redemption of the world.</p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, that to put any worth upon any other mans works as to affirme they can deſerve, by their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, that he ſhould free them from eternall death, or render them the reward of eternall life; yea, and that they can ſupererogate for others alſo: I ſay obſerve, that any of this Doctrine is, not only a blaſphemous derogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Chriſts workes, but alſo againſt the guift of God imputing it, arrogating to man that which is not his: alſo it overthroweth the foundation of mans ſalvation, and that fundamentally, for it not only makes voyd the object of Juſtification, but cuts off mans worke of Faith to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in a juſtifying relation, as before is obſerved againſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> pag. 78.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, is it ſo, that God eſtated the Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that if it were by him fulfilled. God by him ſhould then receive the praiſe of his juſtice to all eternity in the foreſaid twofold reſpects, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 12.13. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did fulfill it, that by him under
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:156664:65"/> divine juſtice, hee alſo might receive the praiſe of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to all eternity, and that Chriſt accordingly did render him his juſtice to every tittle, and pronounc'd it finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Hence obſerve that God never intended, nor needed to make a perſonall reprobation of moſt men to unavoydable deſtruction to the everlaſting praiſe of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>For if the Covenant had bin fulfilled by either <hi>Adam,</hi> it it was to the praiſe of his juſtice to all eternity, as here we ſee, and the Covenant of grace is ſo full to this point that all mankinde may aſcend to eternall life by Chriſt, if they will but apply themſelves in what they have received, and to what they might receive in him, yet by Chriſt Gods juſtice is eternally glorifyed, as is proved.</p>
               <p>Therefore God never made in vaine, ſuch a perſonall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, to paſſe upon the moſt of mankinde.</p>
               <p>Fiftly obſerve, that when I ſay, <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to all mankinde in generall, or to man beleeving truth more ſpeciall,</hi> as is deſcribed, I meane not Chriſt his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe eſſentially as God, nor his perfect love as naturally an holy man, without ſinne; nor all thoſe manifold works hee did as perſonally God man, even to blood and death, but by his righteouſneſſe that was imputed; I meane only this one worke, to which all precedently named, were but meanes, namely, his diſſolving Satans lyes<note n="*" place="margin">Our ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> improved his perſonall perfections as our ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nall glory for man with Angels, or the contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his revealed will in either eſtate, the which gave full ſatisfaction to divine Iuſtice, and was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the behalf of the World, and therefore imputed to the worlds felicity, and mans the cheife part therein.</note> by witnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gods truth, as is deſcribed, <hi>pag.</hi> 101.102.111.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why this only was imputed, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only this is it which all men ſhould ſet to their ſeales in this fourth eſtate of man, and was the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> worke in the Covenant, and then to be imputed to the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicity of the world, as <hi>Chapt.</hi> the 2.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> witneſſing Gods truth to the repelling all the lying powers of Satan, is only that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which by God is imputed to the ſupernaturall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the world in Generall, or to man beleeving truth more ſpeciall, as precedently is deſcribed.</p>

               <p>But upon Chriſts fulfilling all righteouſneſſe, this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was canceld, for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Gentiles, remember,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that you being in times paſt</hi> Gentiles <hi>in the fleſh were called uncircumciſed, by that which was called the circumciſion in the fleſh made with hands, that at that time yee were without Chriſt, being aliants from the common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſes, having no hope, and without</hi> God <hi>in the world. But now in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>yee who ſometimes were afarre off, are made nye by the blood of Chriſt, for hee is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition betweene us, having ab l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Likewiſe God pouring out his ſpirit upon all fleſh was extraordinary, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>this is it which was ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt days,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:156664:66"/> ſaith God, <hi>I will powre out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and your daughters ſhall propheſie, and your old men ſhall dreame dreames, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 16.</p>
               <p>And this powring out of Gods ſpirit was two-fold; that is externall and internall: firſt externall; for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did in his externall call, excitively draw the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to Chriſt, it was but implicit by the voyce of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as formerly is declared, likewiſe his externall drawing of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was but by the Goſpell as wrapt up in the glorious vaile of <hi>Moſes;</hi> therefore the externall way to eternall life to all the world, was then but narrow and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, but now made broad and perſpicuous by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked externall demonſtration thereof, as in the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie the wonderfull gift of Miracles by the Apoſtles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Oracles of life more cleare than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and divulging the ſame in burning zeale for the glory of God, by the ſalvation of the world, and in the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gift of tongues by plainneſſe of ſpeech, excitively draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or rather God in Chriſt by them reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes, and manifeſting to them, that their precedent ignorance hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not; but now admoniſhing all men to returne from lying vanities, to imbrace their owne mercies that the confuſed fugitives of <hi>Babel,</hi> taſting the waters of life at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> cryed out, ſaying, How heare wee every man in his owne tongue, wherein we were borne, <hi>Parthiaus, Medes</hi> and <hi>Elamites,</hi> and the dwellers in <hi>Meſopotomia,</hi> and <hi>Iudea,</hi> and in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and in <hi>Pontus, Aſia, Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the parts of <hi>Lybia</hi> about <hi>Cyrene,</hi> ſtrangers of <hi>Rome, Iewes</hi> and <hi>Proſelites, Cretes</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> we doe heare them ſpeake in our tongues, the wonderfull works of God, and they were all amaſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>Thus from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or the throne of God, now did iſſue the living ſtreames of eternall life to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth, dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, wherefore precedently Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Yee ſhall be my witneſſes in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and in all</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and to the utmoſt parts of all the earth,</hi> and accordingly at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they firſt receiv'd this power from above, which they thus divulged, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.39. and ſo God perſwaded <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> and in this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary call he was found of them that ſought him not, nor
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:156664:67"/> asked after him, all being gone out of the way, and become abominable, none ſeeking after God doing good, no not one.</p>
               <p>Thus God, who keepeth covenant and mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands according to his purpoſe, as with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated and prepared them to this glory. So now hee called them to it in Chriſt Jeſus externally: and ſo much for the externall powring out of his ſpirit upon all fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the internall powring out of Gods ſpirit upon all fleſh, I ſay powring out; becauſe in compariſon of his precedent dropping into the hearts of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſpirits, as aforeſaid, and as to the <hi>Iewes</hi> but ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compariſon of this powring out in this day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acceptable yeere of the Lord: It was but ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as by drops, and that which the ſpirit did now internally powre out upon the ſpirits of all men, may be reduced to two generall heads: firſt, whereſoever the Oracle of truth manifeſted Gods gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed, as it went from Kingdome to kingdome by the conduct of the ſpirit like a Chariot of light and life riſing upon the nations as <hi>the ſunne of righteouſneſſe with health under his wings:</hi> the firſt powring into the ſpirit of man for health, was this, namely, it did quicken or enliven the originall principle of amity to God, and enmity to Satan, even as it did upon the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> by Chriſts reſtauration of all in the type then put into the nature of man, hereditarily to deſcend, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently is proved; ſo now likewiſe upon Chriſt his fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all righteouſneſſe in the truth, this infuſed principle which was now dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, was by the imbreathing of the ſpirit of God, whereſoever the Goſpell came, it quickened and enlivened man in diſpoſitions to harken to the externall call of Chriſt in the object of faith, to the end they might receive the gift of faith, to receive life in Chriſt; wherefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any man will doe Gods Will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeake of my ſelfe,</hi> Joh. 7.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe he ſaith, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the houre is comming, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5.25.</p>
               <p>And the laſt clauſe where it is ſaid, they ſhall live, leades us to the ſecond part, namely, the ſpirits internall, more ſpeciall powring upon all fleſh, that is, anſwerably, as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:156664:67"/> men did come in the precedent enlivened or renewed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to Chriſt in the Goſpel, as being the object of faith held forth by the word of truth, as the brazen Serpent; from thence by the powring out of the Spirit, they ſhould receive the ſpirit of faith to be able to receive life in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith, as before in the precedent <hi>P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> that is, under thoſe renewed diſpoſitions towards Chriſt, <hi>and ſtand up from the dead,</hi> that is, and rouſe up this grace to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Gods call, to the object of life, <hi>and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> that is, the light of right beliefe, as the truth is in <hi>Ieſus,</hi> from ſtrength to ſtrength, and ſo to receive life in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14.8.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> the Apoſtle ſaid of God, <hi>even when wee were dead in ſinnes hath he quickened us together with Chriſt, by grace yee are ſaved,</hi> Epheſ. 2.5. and ſaith hee <hi>not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt, for wee are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Ieſus unto good workes, which God hath afore ordained, that we ſhould walke in them,</hi> that is, by his fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as before is declared.</p>

                     </gap>l and to doe of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and the ground why God did thus extraordinarily externally, and internally powre out his ſpirit upon the ſpirits of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, was this, <hi>That as ſinne</hi> by their apoſtaſie <hi>had raigned unto death, even ſo might his grace raigne through righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe unto eternall life by Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 5.21.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ground was this, that unleſſe God had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citively drawne them by powring out his ſpirit, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor would ever come to him by Chriſt, which is implyed by the words of our Saviour, when he rebuked the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their proud apoſtacie being dead, to live in him, he ſaith, <hi>no man can come unto me, except the Father which ſent me draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe to thoſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> having the power of this enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit imbreathing upon their ſpirits, and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that we may plainly ſee, even under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary powring out of Gods ſpirit upon all fleſh, his proceedings are equally alike to all, without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for then he ſends forth his great Commiſſion into all

               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve by the way, that God is a God keeping covenant; for as hee ordained theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> to glory by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham;</hi> he now accordingly called them to receive it; wherefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> urgeth the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon this ground, as well as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to returne to God in Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſsion of ſinnes, and receive the holy Ghoſt;</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>the promiſe is made to you and to your children, and to all that are a farre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Acts 2.39.</p>

                  </label> The Apoſtle might well make this reſtriction, yet never have any ſuch intention.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he knew Gods proceedings upon the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and nations of the earth, ſhould be by degrees, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome ſooner, and ſome later, and not all at one time, as all on a day, as wee uſe to ſay, therefore hee might well ſay, <hi>as many as our Lord God ſhall call,</hi> although it be intended perſonally alike to all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle might well ſay, <hi>as many as the Lord God ſhall call,</hi> becauſe hee knew God from the beginning had ordained to deny the efficacie of his call to ſome ſort of men, as he did to <hi>Cain;</hi> for when he predeſtinated both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus with <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee then gave the ſame rule of curſedneſſe to man turning this grace into wantonneſſe, as well as bleſſedneſſe to man ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it in the obedience of faith, as formerly is declared, therefore hee might well ſay, <hi>as many as our Lord God ſhall call, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe our Saviour alluding to this ſame rule of curſing and bleſſing, to families and cities in the call of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:156664:68"/> theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>Some are the ſonnes of peace, and ſome are not,</hi> Luke 10.3.5.18. For, not onely believers, but all mankinde in generall, eſpecially at that time of grace, were the ſonnes of peace, that is, in a reconcileable condition to God in Chriſt Jeſus: as for example, although <hi>Cain</hi> was not a believer, as was <hi>Abel,</hi> yet there was a time when hee was a ſonne of peace, that is reconcileable in Chriſt his acceptable righteouſneſſe by Gods owne nterrogative teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, although afterwards hee was not for rejecting the ſpirits reproofe of ſinne, and ſo gracious an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him to ſubmit to receive life and glory, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly is proved.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe our Saviour, according to this rule of curſing and bleſſing in his peculiar prayer for his Apoſtles, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ambaſſage for the reconciliation of the world, he then alſo prayes for the world excluſively and incluſively, excluſively, to thoſe that perſiſt in their precedent apoſtaſie againſt the imbreathing of the foreſaid externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall light when it came unto them, and hated his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and in this ſenſe, (ſaith hee) <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> for ſo runnes the force of the implication.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, hee prayes incluſively, for them which were, as once was <hi>Cain,</hi> the ſubjects of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherefore for them hee prayes which ſhall believe in him through their ambaſſage, directly according to the rule delivered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Joh. 17.8.9.14, 15.20. So likewiſe according to this rule of curſing and bleſſing, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. the Apoſtles by diſtinguiſhing betweene them which were the ſonnes of peace, and them which were not, that is, betweene the apoſtate <hi>Iewes</hi> reſiſting the call of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as men of old ordained to that damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and betweene the concourſe of <hi>Gentiles</hi> in that great aſſembly, who alſo of old by covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> were given to Chriſt, and ordain'd to that ſalvation, wherfore the Apoſtle rightly referres the efficacious call of the ſpirit by their doctrine to the levell of Gods fore-ordination with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as cutting betweene theſe two ſorts of people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>when the Gentiles heard this,</hi> that is, their doctrine of God, his intended mercy to them, <hi>they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordain'd to eternall life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> but they ſhooke off the duſt of their feet againſt theſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> therby witneſſing, that they ſtood as men that were
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:156664:69"/> under the foreſaid curſe or ordination to eternall death, for deſpiſing that grace which the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> according to Gods covenant, did now imbrace, <hi>verſe.</hi> 41.46, 47.48.51. So that the point is cleare, that Gods proceedings is without all reſpect of perſons, according to his covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> for curſing and bleſſing.</p>
               <p>And the ground why man ſinning through ignorance and unbeliefe is the ſumme or ſubject of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and not obſtinate refuſers of the light, is, becauſe they are more properly ſubjectively diſpoſed to mercy then the others; for if the one knew the evill of the thing as doth the other, they would not ſo ſtand out; hence Saint <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er</hi> ſaith, to ſome of the <hi>Iewes, I wot that through ignorance yee did it, as did alſo your Rulers,</hi> implying that had they knowne, that is, as did ſome others, <hi>they would not have ſlaine the Lord of glory,</hi> Acts 3.15.17.19. So likewiſe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>I was a blaſphemer, a perſecuter and injurious, but I obtained mercy, becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I did it ignorantly in unbeliefe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. So likewiſe to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> hee preached the ſame doctrine, ſaying, <hi>This time of ignorance God wincked at, but now he commandeth all men every where to returne.</hi> Acts 17.30. Wherefore the Apoſtle might well ſay, <hi>as many as the Lord God ſhall call,</hi> and yet intend no ſuch thing as is pretended.</p>
               <p>And for concluſion, here firſt obſerve, that there hath proceeded from God a threefold extraordinary call of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in Chriſt Jeſus to enjoy their day of Grace, as a day of grace to receive in his gift of righteouſneſſe the day of eternall glory: The firſt was immediately upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall in the promiſed ſeed of the <hi>Woman, Chap.</hi> 4. This was equally alike univerſally to all mankinde.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was at <hi>Noahs</hi> comming out of the Arke, when God renewed this covenant of grace to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes with them and his ſeed after them, which at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all alike without reſpect of perſons, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The third extraordinary call of the world was this of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as is precedently in this <hi>Chapter</hi> inlarged, when God was found of them that ſought him not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo, that it is extraordinary mercy in God thus <hi>to be found of them that ſought him not;</hi> hence obſerve, that this is no ordinary rule for man to rely upon, becauſe, what is Gods extraordinary rule, is not his ordinary rule to man.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:156664:69"/>
               <p>Thirdly, obſerve, that in this extraordinary calling of the Gentiles to receive the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God hath enlivened the aforeſaid dead principle of enmity to Satan, and Amity to himſelfe, that hee will then have man to put forth this enlivened diſpoſition to come to him, as he doth excitively draw forth that internall inclination, ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey further mercies.</p>
               <p>I ſay hence obſerve, that as God will crowne one grace with the guift of another, ſo alſo<note n="(a)" place="margin">From this ground it is, that in this fourth eſtate of man, what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands man to doe before juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, or after, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his own effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what he commands; that is, if man thus apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, 24. &amp;c.</note> he will communicate by exerciſe of the inferiour, the conferrence of a grace more Superior, as to the firſt inlivened principle, he will adde the guift of Faith, and to Faith a power rightly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his guift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe accounted to be mans to remiſſion of ſinnes, which is his juſtification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his eternall life by ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But it will here be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label>

               </p>
               <p>Not ſo, but becauſe he works to ſubmit more, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by mercy more, therefore he receives more, but he that (as did <hi>Cain</hi>) by pride ſo refuſed to ſubmit, or doth it in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe degrees, he therefore receives leſſe mercy, or none at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, is it ſo, that the force of Gods extraordinary pouring forth his ſpirit raiſeth the minde of man to him being dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes?</p>
               <p>Then hence obſerve alſo, when the ſpirit of a man is dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, namely, when it is habitually ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to ſeeke its eternall felicity for the worth of his own righteouſneſſe, or the like errors; or habitually habituated to terminate his felicity in a terreſtriall or ſenſuall good of bodily contentments, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20.</p>
               <p>And the ground why this is ſo, is becauſe theſe habituall errors or the like, doth<note n="(b)" place="margin">When man is in his ſpirit dead, to live by beliefe in the object of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; if then Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breath, to enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mans ſpirit to hearken, by ſom diſpoſitions to Gods voyce, and to bring him ſo beliefe in the object of life, he then periſheth eternally, for now man can do noe more to raiſe his mind to God in Chriſt, as the object of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to ſalvation, then can the Leopard to change his ſpots, or the Black-moore his skin.</note> extinguiſh, even the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to true godlineſſe<note n="(c)" place="margin">Although it doth extinguiſh the inclination to true godlineſſe, yet in ſome there may remain diſpoſitions to civility or the like.</note> namely, <hi>mans internall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to God, and his enmity to Satan, flowing from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall grace of the Covenant;</hi> but what it is to be twice dead and pluckt up by the roots, appeares in the 12 <hi>Chapt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:156664:70"/>
               <p>Is it ſo, <hi>that when Chriſt did thus powre out his Spirit upon all fleſh, that yet at this time be denyed the ſpirit of Faith to his Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spouſe to the moſt part, for their proud Apoſtaſie to their enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rejection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, how rightly the Lord of glory returned the ſame upon them, <hi>But I ſaid unto you, that yee alſo have ſeene mee and beleeve not; All that the Father</hi>

               <p>Is it ſo, <hi>that when Chriſt came perſonally into the world, he then found Iewes and Gentiles generally both dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes to him, as the object of juſtification to their life and glory, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his Nationall Spouſe generally?</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Is it ſo, <hi>that Chriſt his righteouſneſſe as imputed by the Fathers gift, and conveyed from Kingdome to Kingdome, by the word of truth, was and is the only object of life and glory, and the removall of mans miſery, which ſubmitted by beliefe of truth to receive that gift of righteouſneſſe in that ſacred object?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then hence obſerve, how rightly ſpake the Lord Jeſus Chriſt of himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>I am the way and the truth and the life, no man can come unto the Father but by mee.</hi> Joh. 14.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Againe, is it ſo; <hi>that this extraordinary calling of the Gentiles to righteouſneſſe, life and glory, being dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes by their precedent Apoſtacie, that even the ſecond Adams ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry righteouſneſſe obtained as upon</hi> Adams <hi>fall, ſo at this time alſo, that this world ſhould be mans day of grace againe, as a day of grace to receive in it the gift of eternall glory, the world of Gentiles being under wrath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then hence obſerve, that from this ground Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> rightly brings in Chriſts imputative righteouſneſſe as oppoſed, not only to our unrighteouſneſſe and miſery in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, but alſo interminglingly oppoſing it againſt all mens own perſonall ſinnes, againſt the grace of God in Chriſt, that whereas ſinne in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects had abounded, ſo Gods grace by his gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe did ſuperabound, as appeareth from the 8. verſe to the end of that Chapter.</p>

               <p>Hence obſerve, how rightly Chriſt in his life time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.16. oppoſed the certainty of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for life and glory, to his Apoſtate Spouſe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then to bee extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ver. 26. and in the three next verſes, grounding the ſtable felicity of the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> only on his free gift, and his Fathers power, oppoſing it to all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powers whatſoever: for although the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> became totally ſeparated from Chriſt as now they ſtand, yet ſo ſhall never the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when they are againe ingrafted into Chriſts viſible Church, as was before Prophecied by<note n="*" place="margin">For by this word, <hi>thoſe days,</hi> is not only meant the firſt extraordinary light of grace and truth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged in the Goſpell by the Apoſtles Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but this Prophecy alſo extends to thoſe dayes of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary call of the Iewes, mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26, &amp; 27. when alſo ſhall come in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles.</note>

               <p>Chriſt alſo manifeſts his impartiall proceedings unto the Spirits of men, intending and extending eternall life to all and all alike, in this ordinary call of the Gentiles, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Luke</hi> the 8. for there he compares the Oracles of life for Doctrine of the Kingdome of grace to ſeed, and all mens mindes to whom the Goſpell comes, to ground variouſly diſpoſ'd, and that from thoſe various diſpoſitions in the hearts of men: the oracle of life ordinarily did variouſly take effect by the influence of his ſpirit, and in the opening of this parable, he referres thoſe various diſpoſitions of men to foure heads, for ſaith hee, <hi>the parable is this, the ſeed is the word of</hi> God. ver. 12. from which ſeed of life, the firſt ſort of men received only a glance of the object of faith, and no more: for ſaith hee, <hi>thoſe by the high way ſide, are thoſe that heare, then cometh the Divell and taketh the word out of their hearts, leaſt they ſhould believe and be ſaved:</hi> therefore theſe do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in any degree, they have onely a glance and no more; and the reaſon is, becauſe their mindes were as a common roade for Satan his allurements, and perſiſting in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Apoſtacie, extinguiſhing all light of the enlivened principle of enmity to Satan, wherefore ſaith Chriſt to ſuch, <hi>if the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe?</hi> Mat. 6.23.</p>
               <p>Againe, the ſecond ſort of mens mindes under the ſeed of life receive a further diſpoſition to the object of Faith; for they believe to conſolation, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. they on the rocke when they here receive the word with joy, and theſe have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:156664:72"/> away, and the reaſon is, becauſe their mindes by contrary habites were uncapable of a depth or ſettled reception of the ſeed of life, as is the rocke to retaine any ſeed to fructifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore theſe could abide no force of triall, but fell away and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>Againe, the third ſort of mens mindes on which fell the ſeed of life, were further diſpoſed for reception of Chriſt the object of Faith, as <hi>verſe</hi> 14. and that which fell amongſt thornes, which when they have heard, goe forth and are choaked with the cares and the pleaſures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection, implying, they went forward in the profeſſion of true Religion, yet their fruit fell ſhort of perfection, becauſe they came too much in the ſpirit of <hi>Cain,</hi> glewed to the poſſeſſions and pleaſures of this world; ſo extinguiſhing in their ſoules the operation of Gods ſpirit in the ſeed of life, and therefore come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Againe, the fourth ſort of men are further diſpoſed to the object of Faith; For they in an honeſt and good heart from the force of the Goſpel which enlivened. as in all the reſt, the principle of amity to God, and of enmity to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and it being carefully preſerved by them came to heare the Oracle of life, and ſo they received the ſpirit of Faith to receive the object of Faith, and ſo brought forth fruit with patience; For <hi>verſe</hi> 15. the Text ſaith, but that on the good ground are they which with an honeſt and good heart, having heard the word, keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
               <p>Now, that all this was ſpoken by Chriſt with reſpect to future times, in the ordinary courſe of his ambaſſadors in the adminiſtration of the ſeed of life is plaine in the 3 next enſuing verſes: For when he had ſaid that the end of this heavenly light was to be divulged, imply'd in the 16. <hi>verſe,</hi> and that by it all ſecrets ſhall be diſcovered, as in the 17. <hi>verſe.</hi> thereupon in the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> hee exhorts, ſaying. <hi>Take heed therefore bow yee heare, for whoſoever hath,</hi> that is, his principle of amity and enmity to Satan, preſerved in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to God, <hi>to him ſhall be given,</hi> that is, the power of Faith to receive Chriſt the object of life, <hi>and whoſoever hath not,</hi> that is at leaſt his renewed principle or diſpoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in him, <hi>from him ſhall be taken away, even that which he ſeemed to have,</hi> as wee ſee in the precedent ſorts of ground, all was taken away, and came to nothing, onely in this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:156664:73"/> fourth ſort of men, the ſeed of life and glory remained.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O man, be faithfull in thy little, and God which gave thee that to receive more; likewiſe will reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thee with more, as from the firſt diſpoſition to the power of faith, and in it leade thee from degree to degree, of an honeſt and good heart, to bring forth fruit with patience; for in it is a threefold ſtrength in the object of faith,<note place="margin">A threefold de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith.</note> namely, of Babes young, Men and Fathers in the faith; and briefly of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>And firſt of Babes, and of them there are two ſorts, one by backſliding from Chriſt the object of Faith, theſe I will onely point at, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 4.5, 6. is implyed, the ſtrength which formerly they had, and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.12.13. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their weakneſſe, into which they were fallen, even ſuch as needed milke unskilfull in the word of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, needing to be taught againe what was the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, <hi>even Babes,</hi> ſaith the Text, but theſe I paſſe.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of Babes are thoſe, which for their union by faith in Chriſt but newly begun, have not had time for further growth in Faith and love, to ſuch Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writes; <hi>as new borne Babes to deſire the ſincere milke of the word that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>hee could not write unto them as unto ſpirituall, but as unto carnall, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babes, in that I have fed you with milke,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1. So ſuch were the Apoſtles themſelves at their firſt union with Chriſt by beliefe of truth: as for inſtance, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> eſteemed the glory of this world before their ſacred functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſiring to be chiefe in it; but Chriſt inſtructed them the contrary, <hi>Mat</hi> 20.26. So likewiſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemes his ſtrength in faith and love to Chriſt above his fellowes, or what indeed it was, but Chriſt informed him to judge better of himſelfe and others, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21 15.17.</p>
               <p>And in a word, at firſt they in their undergoing their functions or beliefe of the myſteries of Chriſt, were but weaklings, for hee ſaith, <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but you cannot beare them now,</hi> Joh. 6.12.13. So much for the firſt degree.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond degree, they are more ſtrong, as having overcome much of this childiſhneſſe; hence Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have written to you young men, becauſe yee are ſtrong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome that wicked one,</hi> the firſt Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. &amp; 14. and in the 15.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:156664:73"/> and 16. verſes, hee leaves them a rule, to preferre this ſtrength, <hi>as not to love the world, neither the things that are in the world, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hee foreſeeing the danger in this ſecond degree of ſtrength in an honeſt and good heart namely, to fall finally, from their union with Chriſt, ſpecially, when youth in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and youth in Faith meete in one and the ſame ſubject: whence S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids a young ſcholler in Chriſts Schoole, to meddle publiquely with the myſteries of Chriſt, or with great warineſſe at leaſt, and his reaſon is, leſt hee be puft up and fall into the condemnation of the Divell: ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> layeth downe another rule to preſerve this ſtrength ſaith he, <hi>let that abide therefore in you, which you have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, if that which you have heard from the beginning remaine in you, yee alſo ſhall continue in the ſonne, and in the father.</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. &amp; 24. 1 Tim. 3.6. implying, if young men ſtrong in the faith carefully avoyd the reflect acts of Faith, as tending to pride, and humbly follow the object of life and glory, they may attaine to a perfect age in the object of Faith: For, although in this ſecond degree, be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall by pride then in the former; yet here is more ſtrength to preſſe forward to the ſacred object of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a continued acception in that righteouſneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: alſo further power to follow it in point of imitation in an honeſt and good heart, to bring forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to a perfect man in Chriſt, and ſo much for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>In opening the third degree, I will firſt define what this juſtifying Faith is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, define what the perfection of this juſtifying Faith is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the eleventh <hi>Chap.</hi> following ſhew how this third degree, or this perfection of Faith is attained in men of an honeſt and good heart; but in opening the firſt point before I define what juſtifying beliefe is, I will ſhew what beliefes are not this beliefe, as,</p>
               <p>Firſt to be induced to follow the object of Faith, onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe occaſionally, by it wee receive our corporall ſupport; this is not ſo much as beliefe in it in any kinde, but onely a following of ſenſe, much like the firſt ſort of ground, which from the ſeed of life received onely a glance of the object of life, and no more, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.25, 26, 27.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:156664:74"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to believe the object of life or oracle of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, onely becauſe it is of good report of thoſe with whom we live.</p>
               <p>This is not to believe divine teſtimony, and divine as divine teſtimony, but to believe it meerely upon humane teſtimony, as did the misbelieving <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſay they, doe any of the Rulers believe in him? implying their beliefe of the Oracle of God was onely grounded upon the Rulers reſpect or credit which they gave to it: So this was but the ſecond ſort of ground on which the ſeed of life was ſowed wanting roote, in time of temptation fell away, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7.48. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.28.</p>
               <p>Againe, to believe the Oracle of God from Gods owne teſtimony, as Gods Oracle in ſeverall reſpects, is not this juſtifying beliefe? for the divells believe the Oracles of God, as Gods Oracle of truth in his gift of Chriſt to the world, and from thence tremble at the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their full damnation, when God ſhall judge the world by the ſeed of the woman, to the finall bruiſe of Satans power: So ſome men believe the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Thus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh virgins have not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall lampe of juſtifying faith, which onely hath in it the right reception of Chriſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet they have the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lampe of beliefe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony, as divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as here wee ſee.</note> Oracle of God as Gods owne Oracle, and from beliefe in God, produce great miracles, and<note n="(b)" place="margin">Theſe men by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſtiled virgins, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the wiſe virgins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the judgement of charity, the Church judgeth them viſible members, untill they diſcover the contrary.</note> glorifie God by the confirmation of the object of Faith, and yet may be as ſome have beene, voyd of love to God. Therefore this is not this juſtifying beliefe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe ſome men may, and doe believe with conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Oracle of life to be Gods true Oracles, and from thence in the ſpirit of propheſie powre out bleſſings upon men of an honeſt and a good heart, as from the Starre of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">But theſe kind of prayers are ſtrivings to bring Gods wil to mans, and not mans will to Gods will.</note> deſiringly crave or pray for that bleſſedneſſe to themſelves, yet not rightly ſubmitting, to the reception of that righteouſneſſe in the object of juſtification as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by God to a ſinner, becauſe in heart they are lifted up either to the eſteeme of their owne perſonall operations or terminate their happineſſe too much in terreſtriall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as fooliſh virgins, ſo periſh in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> and wages of <hi>Balaam,</hi> being the third ſort of ground on which the ſeed of life was ſowed as upon <hi>Cains</hi> ſpirit it was, and choked with the cares and pleaſures of this life, bringing fruit but not to perfection, wanting the<note n="*" place="margin">Here wee ſee why the fooliſh virgins wanted oyle.</note> right reception of Gods gracious oyle of mercy running downe, from Chriſt the head, wherefore this is not that juſtifying
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:156664:74"/> beliefe in men of an honeſt and good heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1. 2 <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10.19. <hi>Numbers</hi> 24.2, 16, 17.23. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4</p>
               <p>And now I come to define what beliefe is, juſtifying faith, and then to define what the perfection of this juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is: yet before I can do either, I muſt briefly open the point of juſtification in foure particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as before is declared, Gods inſtrument is the word of truth by which hee conveyes the object of juſtification, to the minde of man, as from the beginning till now in the word of promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> by tradition conveyed by the ten Fathers down to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then that word being renewed with him, it came downe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him committed to writing, and now by the Apoſtles writings extant to the end of the world. So much for the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The object conveyed or reached unto man by that inſtrument is Gods guift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed or counted to the world in generall, and to man believing truth more ſpecially. So much for the object ſo conveyed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mans neceſſary inſtrument by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this guift of righteouſneſſe from God, is his beliefe of Gods inſtrument, his word of truth as aforeſaid, by which God reacheth to man that object of juſtification, as is formerly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The reaſons moving man to apply his inſtrument of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe to Gods inſtrument, to receive his gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he conceiveth God in that guift is<note n="(a)" place="margin">Here ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Secondly, becauſe he conceives that in this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo imputed or counted to be mans, is conferred the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of miſery, and conveyed all<note n="(b)" place="margin">Here mans will lookes at goodneſſe.</note> felicity. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19.20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe hee conceives his own<note n="(c)" place="margin">Man which out of ſenſe of his ſinne and miſery looks to God as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hath a right aſpect towards eternall felicity, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13.14. <hi>Matth</hi> 5.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6.7.</note> poverty or need of that imputed righteouſneſſe ſo commodious to him, that therefore he applies his hand of beliefe to receive that object for righteouſneſſe to juſtification, and remiſſion of ſinnes to ſalvation.

               <p>And thus did <hi>Abel</hi> ſubmit, as <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4. and as many as by faith thus ſubmit, they then are received and adopted Sonnes in Chriſt; and becauſe Chriſts elect Spouſe did not thus ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 3. ſhe was caſt off. And ſo much for the definition, what juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying beliefe is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the perfection of juſtifying Faith is no more but this, the heart of man adhering to Gods unfeyned gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed for the removall of all miſery, and the conveyance of all felicity ſo firme and ſo farre, as to worke up to God in that object, through all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing difficulties: And I will in briefe prove this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond definition by the perfection of this Faiths operation in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a Father in this third degree of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith as firſt, when God in his promiſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes gave Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe imputed to be the bleſſing of all Nations, and conſequently for his owne; then to this object did he adhere by Faith, working through all that did interpoſe betweene his beleife, and this object of life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. ſaith the Text, <hi>He beleeved even</hi> God <hi>who quickneth the dead, and calleth things which be not as though they were, who againſt hope beleeved in bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is brought in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to God in this ſacred object through the darkneſſe of death, for ſaith the Text, <hi>by Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Iſaak; that is by death to be deſtroyed: &amp; he that had received the promiſes. <hi>i.</hi> of all happines figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Child for mankinde, and for himſelf offered up his only begotten Sonne of whom it was ſaid, <hi>in</hi> Iſaak <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> accounting that God was able to

               <p>And to conclude this point of Chriſt his impartiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> without all reſpect of Perſons, by the operations of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in his ſacred ordinances is alſo implyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. wherefore he thus ſaith, <hi>bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my dores, for who ſo findeth mee, findeth l fe, and ſhall obtaine fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS it is in the perfections of nature, the life ſuperior containes in it ſelfe the perfection of all inferior lives, as in <hi>Adam,</hi> Chapt. the firſt, ſo the perfection of juſtifying beliefe, containes in it ſelfe vertually, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior beliefes; hence it is, that the improvement of this faith is various in its operations, yet ever terminating to God in the object of <hi>juſtification,</hi> as its moſt proper center, and ſo it comes to its full perfection formerly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Hence Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith of <hi>Abraham, Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his workes, and by works faith was made perfect,</hi> James 2.20.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:156664:76"/> him from his countrey, and from his fathers houſe; the operations of his faith then began to put forth; for ſaith the Text, <hi>He went out, not knowing whither he went,</hi> Hebr. 11.8. but when hee was come to the promiſed Land, there God tryed the ſtrength of his faith; for hee was driven to depart this land of his hope to ſuſtaine his life in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there fell into danger of death, ſo that his ſtrength began to ſtoope, as appeares by his excuſe to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to ſave his life, yet God that will in point of triall, lay as much weight as faith's meaſure can beare, and worke through to his faithfulneſſe, yet he will lay no more then it can ſo worke through, if it be improv'd: So to <hi>Abraham</hi> with the temptation, he gives an iſſue by his happy returne to the land of promiſe; the figure of eternall felicity, and there <hi>Abraham</hi> refreſhed his faith in Gods promiſe of Chriſt the object of all felicity in his ſatisfactory ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3.10 11, 12, 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>

               <p>The firſt is drawne from the nature of the exerciſing any ability, which the more 'tis exerciſed the more 'tis perfected; for as uſe makes perfectneſſe, ſo cuſtome breeds another nature. Hence ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have remembred thy name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy Law; this I had, becauſe I kept thy ſtatutes.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:156664:78"/> man that delighteth in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth meditate day and night; he ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in due ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 1.2.3. Pſal. 119.55.100.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon is becauſe the moſt perfect operations of juſtifying faith, brings man moſt paſſively ſubjective to God to receive in his gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fulneſſe of all that leads or ends in bleſſedneſſe: therfore as every effect, the more it doth ſubject it ſelfe to it's cauſe, the more influence for it's perfection it doth receive from that cauſe, ſo alſo in this: Hence ſaith God to his redeemed Spouſe, <hi>I am IEHOVAH thy GOD, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.10 but by the way for further incouragement to men of an honeſt and good heart to preſſe forward to faiths perfection; I will here explicate the different opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: betweene the perfection of faith in the one, and the imperfections of the other; as, firſt betweene righteous <hi>Lot</hi> weake in ſaith, and <hi>Abraham</hi> perfect therein; for <hi>Lot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more weake in the ſpirit of faith, was therefore more ſtrong in the ſpirit of this world, as once were the Apoſtles, deſiring to be chiefe in ſenſuall felicities, but <hi>Abrahams</hi> mind was farre more free from theſe intanglements; for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his communion with Saints in the bond of peace, and love in relation to Chriſt, before the fertile pleaſures of the plains of <hi>Sodome;</hi> for to enjoy this, he leaves <hi>Lot</hi> to chooſe that, and takes for his aboad what <hi>Lot</hi> refuſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8, 9.10.11.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> perfect in faith, eſteemed Chriſt in the object of Faith with reproach, <hi>greater riches then the pleaſures of Egypt: for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> implying, hee eſteemed Gods gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed to be mans exceeding great reward, conſequently his owne, wherefore in Idolatrous <hi>Egypt</hi> hee refuſed his relation to the crowne of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in that hee <hi>refuſed to be called the ſonne of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter,</hi> Gen. 15.1. Heb. 11.24.25.26.</p>
               <p>Again men of an honeſt and good heart, yet weake in the object of life. They then are in zeale againſt ſinners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly pitileſſe, as was <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who for Chriſts ſake would have them conſumed with fire from Heaven; but take man more perfect in beliefe of this ſacred object; then hee knowing the terror of the Lord doth perſwade
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:156664:78"/> men; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe wee thus judge, if one died for all, then were all dead,</hi> implying, becauſe in love Chriſt died for all men then dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, that this love of him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them to perſwade ſinners to life and ſalvation in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 14</p>
               <p>Againe, being but weake in this ſacred object they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſavour the things of men, and not the things of God, as did <hi>Peters</hi> counſell to Chriſt, ſo hee ſtooped to pleaſe men, but not as man perfect in faith becomming all things to all men to ſave ſome, as did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but baſely diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, perverting his truſt which Chriſt put in him, ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the ſalvation of men, as he did at <hi>Antioch;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> more perfect in beliefe of this ſacred object, openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him to his face, not caring what hee or they thought of him in the right diſcharge of his ambaſſage to them, <hi>Marke</hi> 8.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Againe, men of an honeſt and good heart, yet weake in faith to this ſacred object; the croſſe of Chriſt will bring them to doubt, as did the men going to <hi>Emaus;</hi> for they ſaid, wee truſted it had beene he which ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luke 24.21.25. but on the contrary, man perfect in faith under the croſſe, ſaith. <hi>We know that the Sonne of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, that wee may know him that is true, even his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> this is, <hi>the true God, and eternall life,</hi> 1 John. 5.20.</p>
               <p>Againe, man weake in this ſacred object of juſtification, doth over value his inherent righteouſneſſe, telling Chriſt What great things hee will doe for him more then others as did <hi>Peter;</hi> but man more perfect in beliefe of this ſacred object, is of another minde, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, who is fit for theſe things?</hi> meaning to doe great things for Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ambaſſage, and ſaith he, <hi>wee know but in part darkely through a glaſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. 1 Cor. 13.8. and ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Woe is mee, becauſe I am a man uncleane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a man of uncircumciſed lips,</hi> Eſay 6. And the ground of the point is this: man perfect in beliefe of Gods gift of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed, firmely believes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth, that the ſeed of the Serpent intermingling his inherent righteouſneſſe (therefore makes it internally as a menſtruous cloth) and externally at the beſt but unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: wherefore, as hee deſires to be found in Chriſt his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:156664:79"/> righteouſneſſe in point of imitation, to ſanctification; ſo alſo to be found in it, as imputed for a continuall accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation, ſtill referring all his great workes for Chriſt, to Chriſt his owne efficiency in him, as Saint <hi>Paul, not I, but Chriſt in mee,</hi> Phil. 3.9.10.</p>
               <p>Againe, a third reaſon why God gives this perfection of faith to men of an honeſt heart, which thus exerciſe to him more then to them, which to this object of life, leſſe exerciſe is not onely becauſe mercy pleaſeth him, but alſo becauſe he loves to glorifie his<note n="(a)" place="margin">Here note, that from one and the ſame principall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in this life, the Saints undiſſoluble union with Chriſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their finall diſſolution from him, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods love to his juſtice in the diſtribution of his mercy.</note> juſtice in the diſtribution of his mercy, becauſe all his attributes are diſplay'd at an equall diſtance, as in the Parable of the talents doth appeare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24.</p>
               <p>And from this ground Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that both hee and they muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things done in his body according to that hee hath done, whether it be good or evill,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.1. &amp; Chap. 5.10.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when they come to God according to the force of that infuſed principle, God then gives them the ſpirit of Faith, to receive his gift of righteouſneſſe, not for their good workes, but for Chriſts.</p>

               <p>But to remove this falſe ſurmiſe, becauſe God could ſweare by no greater, he ſweares by himſelfe, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, you ſhall not have any more occaſion to uſe this Proverb in</hi> Iſraell; therefore he explaines his minde in this point, firſt in generall, ſecondly in particular.

               <p>The firſt is drawne from the danger which will inſue, if any of theſe 11. doe not abide in him, namely, periſhing from him for ever; for ſaith he, <hi>if any</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">That is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into me, the true Vine, as now are you, being clean through the word which I have ſpoken.</note> 
                  <hi>man abide not in me, hee is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned in eternall wrath,</hi> for that's implyed: ſo that this firſt reaſon expreſſely proves the point, namely, that the Saints ſhall receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have done in the body for their evill workes of crucifying Chriſt to themſelves by a totall apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie from him, as the object of faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon, to abide in him, is intermingled with a direction how to abide in him, the reaſon it ſelfe is drawne from the contrary good which would redound to theſe eleven Apoſtles, if they did ſo abide in him; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:156664:82"/> is this, that hee by his Word of truth, ſhould abide in them, and they by beliefe of it, muſt abide in him; the good which will redound to them, they then ſhall have their hearts deſire, and both comprehended in theſe words, <hi>If you abide in mee, and my words abide in you, yee ſhall aske what yee will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is alſo double, partly reſpecting God, partly reſpecting themſelves, and both comprehended in theſe words, <hi>herein is my Father glorified, in that you bring forth much fruit,</hi> for ſo ſhall yee be my Diſciples that is, for ſo ſhall you come and be eſtabliſhed to continue my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, as now yee are; wherefore he further ſaith, <hi>Abide in my love; if you keepe my Commandements, you ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Commandements, and abide in his love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon to induce them to abide in him as the object of Faith, is drawne from that remaining tranquillity which wil redound to them from him as the fountain ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; wherefore ſaith he, <hi>theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remaine in you, and that your joy may be full.</hi> Verſe. 11.</p>
               <p>All which arguments to inforce theſe eleaven Apoſtles ſo to abide in him implyes what formerly is expreſt in the firſt reaſon, namely, that they other wayes will come to fall totally by their remiſſeneſſe and come to a finall ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt by Gods juſtice: Likewiſe the Apoſtles themſelves rightly taught the ſame doctrine, both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of the Saints in generall; as for inſtance, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes, chap.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not not high minded, but feare; for if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed leſt alſo he ſpare not thee,</hi> verſe 20 &amp; 21.</p>

Heb. 6.4. So much for the proofe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:156664:82"/> of the third Reaſon, that God loves to glorifie his Juſtice by the diſtribution of his Mercy, even to the members of Chriſt, without any perſonall reſpect, therefore much more to all mankinde, and to all alike, as hee preached to <hi>Cain</hi> in the firſt modell <hi>if thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? if thou doeſt not well, ſinne lies at the doore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, all mankinde, none excepted, ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> was caſt out of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> are, and ſo ſhall be to the end of the world, in one of theſe three conditions or eſtates: firſt, either in the univerſall grace and favour of God by Chriſt Jeſus, and this is before the gift of juſtifying faith; or ſecondly in the ſpeciall grace and favour of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and this is when man by beliefe of truth is knit to God in Chriſt, as hee is the object of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, in the ſtate of rejection from the firſt, as was <hi>Cain,</hi> before he came to Faith; or from the ſecond as are ſome of the Saints, for their apoſtaſie from Chriſts owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by his doctrine to his peculiar Apoſtles, <hi>Iudas</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and <hi>Pauls</hi> teſtimony of himſelfe and other Saints, and of Chriſts nationall Spouſe by Gods teſtimony, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. and as wee ſee by wofull experience this ſixteene hundred yeeres and more.</p>
               <p>Againe, I having precedently defined what is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of juſtifying faith, I will now define what is the perfection of the man in whom it is; or thus, what man is a righteous man. Man in his firſt eſtate was righteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his intentions and operations was an exact perfection of degrees according to natures moſt right rules in the eſtate of creation, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But now in this fourth eſtate of man,<note place="margin">The definition of a righteous man.</note> hee is a righteous man, who in any degree doth by a right beliefe ſubmit; ſo as that he receives Gods gift of Chriſts righteouſneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to eternall life by ſalvation, deſireably endeavouring to conforme to that righteouſneſſe in ſome degree to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

               <p>Againe, his fall was not totall, becauſe God extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily reſerved ſome virtuall ſeed of beliefe in him to the object of Juſtification, and therefore his backſliding was not totall, nor internally, doing all which the wicked man doth; for as long as the leaſt degree of that ſeed remaines that man is in Chriſt the object of Faith, and that God did reſerve a ſeed, is cleare by his ſpeciall and particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Salomons</hi> behalfe, ſaying, <hi>if hee commit iniquity, I will chaſtice him with rods of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men, but my mercy ſhall not depart away from him.</hi>

               <p>And the ground of this extraordinary mercy by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was this, becauſe <hi>Salomon,</hi> as ſitting King on <hi>Sion hill,</hi> the promiſed ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> hee ſo was in thoſe dayes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable figure of Chriſt, the Sonne of <hi>Davids</hi> eternall throne; therefore God extraordinarily reſerved in <hi>Salomon</hi> a light of beliefe, virtually to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the<note n="*" place="margin">If for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods grace, then not for love to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> perſon, more then to any other mans perſon; for Gods love to all mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is one and the ſame, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the grounds of Gods love in his gift of Chriſt to the world, <hi>pag.</hi> 40, 41.</note> glory of his owne grace in <hi>Salomons</hi> eternall ſalvation; therefore his fall was neither totall nor finall.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>behold, Satan hath deſired to winnow you, that hee may ſift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not,</hi> Luke 22.32. as if he ſhould ſay, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> by reaſon of your raſhneſſe and remiſſeneſſe to my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admoniſhments; Satan hath much deſired to take an advantage againſt you, totally to extinguiſh thy faith and love to me, but my requeſt to my Father hath beene more then ordinary for thee, that thou mighteſt not periſh from mee, therefore in time of neede, Chriſts words of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent admoniſhment, was remembred to <hi>Peters</hi> ſoule, for his returne to him in the object of Faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. &amp; 61. and the ground of this extraordinary mercy was two-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he being a believer; therefore as Chriſt is the Saviour of all men, ſo eſpecially of <hi>Peter</hi> in this his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, more then to <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was not a believer; for, ſaith the Text, <hi>hee is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, not onely a believer, but a believing Apoſtle ſet apart to publiſh the Goſpell to the world, therefore more to Chriſt then an ordinary believer, and therefore Chriſts Prayer was for him more then ordinary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that his fall was neither totall nor finall; for whenſoever it is totall, it is finall; and in ſome twice dead, and pluckt up by the roots, and ſo none can be but thoſe which have beene right believers; for to be twice dead, implyeth to be twice alive: the firſt life is the precedent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of amity to God, and enmity to Satan; or, if it be renewed, and this is a life preceding faith flowing from the univerſall grace of the Covenant of life and glory, as before is proved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond life is the life of juſtifying Faith, I meane man rightly united by believing, to Chriſt, the object of life, and when he dies to the later, he dies to the former alſo, and therfore twice dead, and never lives to God againe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iude, verſ.</hi> 12.

               <p>So on the contrary, <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> after true faith in Chriſt the object of life, were the onely two men menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Scriptures, which by apoſtaſie, went the furtheſt out from God, that ever returned, and was received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſo that in theſe foure in each condition, God hath ſhewed us the utmoſt line or length of the riches of his mercy, in which hee will be pleaſed to glorifie his grace to miſerable man: For if <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> ſpirits had but degenerated into <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> hatred, they had fallen into the unpardonable ſinne.</p>

               <p>And from this ſame ground whence wee know not the ſpecificating internall formes of things, it is, that we know not God his terminating of the will, wherefore, wee muſt in this point live by faith, that God doth it according to his Word and ſo reſt.</p>

For ſo hee turned the oracle of life and glory into Satans darkneſſe, as that liar and murtherer from the beginning; but this prophecie of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a demonſtrative deſcription of this great Antichriſt in three particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his place of reſidence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the height of his aſpired Throne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by what ſhall remove him from his place, by his finall ruine. Of theſe briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, his place of reſidence is not within the place of Paganiſme or Turciſme, where Gods eſpeciall preſence is moſt remote, for ſaith the Text, <hi>he ſitteth in the Temple of God,</hi> implying his ſeat is where Gods moſt ſpeciall preſence of grace in Chriſt, is moſt demonſtratively reſiant, as once it was in the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to his elect Spouſe, more then in any place of all the world beſides, the which now is only in the confines of Chriſtendome, Gods viſible Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> therefore his ſeate at large, is only within Chriſtendome, but his moſt peculiar ſeate is in the ſecond point following.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, alſo he is to be knowne by the height of his Throne, who as ſaith the Text, <hi>oppoſeth all that is called God,</hi> or that is worſhipped: So that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God; ſhewing himſelfe that he is God. Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the height of his aſpired Throne in Satans dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not only demonſtratively above the Thrones of Kings, and Emperors within Chriſtendome, but in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:156664:87"/> place where God moſt properly doth demonſtrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the glory of his grace, which is twofold, that is, in the object and in the Subject, namely in the object of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and in the Subject, that is, mans beliefe of that object, in both which reſpects Antichriſt doth aſpire.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by extinguiſhing Gods guift of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as imputed to mans<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the object, is God th Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gift of Ch iſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto man by his inſtrument the word of truth, as was the brazen Serpent by an inſtrument of wood: but juſtification in the Subject, is man, which by right beliefe of truth doth receive into his minde that object, as the eye did the braſen Serpent, and in that inſtant of time, this mans ſinne is removed from his perſon; as farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt. I doe not meane a totall removall of ſinne inherently, but a totall removall of the guilt and pun ſhment of ſins, paſt, preſent, as long as he doth ſo adhere unto that object actually, or virtually, but no longer.</note> juſtification and ſalvation. which is the only object in which God ſits moſt properly, as in his mercies-ſeate, to the praiſe of his glorious grace in the ſalvation of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only by extinguiſhing this ſacred object, but alſo the Subject, namely the mindes of mankinde, to extinguiſh that beliefe from them, by which God ought to ſit as in his inner-moſt part of the Temple, by their beliefe in the object of juſtification, ſo to receive his worſhip and glory in their eternall ſalvation, but in Gods owne moſt proper ſeate.</p>
               <p>In both theſe reſpects hath the great Antichriſt ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as God, by bringing the mindes of moſt men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and ſubject to him, by their beliefe of his lying do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of their own meritorious works, yea of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for their own and others eternall felicity, ſo in a myſtery he is worſhipped, under a pretence of the Celeſtiall verity, having made voyd this object of juſtification, as alſo all obedience of faith to God in that juſtifying relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo hath hee ſubordinated God beneath himſelfe, and advanced himſelfe in a myſtery, above all that is called <hi>God,</hi> or that is worſhipped within the confines of the<note n="(b)" place="margin">I meane the Greeke Church with the reſt, for although they are in the Turks domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, yet they are not of the Turciſme.</note> viſible Church of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> So likewiſe for a continued ſupply, to ſupport his blaſphemous Throne, he hath fram'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeverall Religions, orders of ſeeming ſanctitie, and his purgatory prayers to Saints alive and dead, his abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous worſhip, all tending but to the ſupport of his Apoſtate Chaire of Thronized glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Satans darkneſſe under the pretence of Gods Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all verity, only to abound in what is Terreſtrially ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Divelliſh: Wherefore the Religion of the Papacie
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:156664:88"/> is rather after the rules of<note n="*" place="margin">Machivells Prince. <hi>p.</hi> 118. 139. 140.</note> Machivell, then after the rules of Holineſſe, from ſacred Scriptures; and the truth is, the whiſpering Divinity which is in <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs be this that there is no God; for if it were not ſo, how durſt they thus adulterate the ſacred Oracles of the eternall Diety, and to ſend forth that cup of Fornications, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Kings of the Earth, to drink down her poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctrines. <hi>And ſo much for the height of the aſpired Throne of this child of perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that which ſhall be his removall from this place by his finall Ruine, in a word is no more but this, that as his riſing was by lies in all deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the darke myſtery of iniquity, under pretence of Gods ſacred verity; ſo on the contrary, his deſtruction ſhall come on by an out-breake, or bright ſhining ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the ſacred verity to man-kinde; and this is it which ſhall be his ruine: for (ſaith the Text) <hi>that wicked one ſhall be reveal'd whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his coming,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.8.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the riſing of this great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt by divers viſions, ſo alſo he ſaw his fall, and finall ruine in two particulars, ſutable to what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this place. Firſt, he ſaw Chriſt the faithfull and true witneſſe, fighting againſt the Nations, which did adhere to Antichriſt, and that with the ſword of his mouth: or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath it, <hi>with the Spirit of his mouth,</hi> meaning, by his word and Spirit, <hi>Reve.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 11.20, 21. So alſo in the 17 <hi>ver.</hi> he ſaw ſome one ſpeciall inſtrument or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Chriſt abiding or ſtanding in the bright demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſimple truth of his ſacred Oracle, ſo excitively ſtirring up Kings and Kingdomes to the deſtruction of the beaſt, for ſaith St. <hi>Iohn I ſaw an Angell ſtanding in the Sun,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, Chriſt in the brightneſſe of his coming, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it, and ſaith he, <hi>he cryed with a loud voyed,</hi> that is, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting by way of triumph<note n="*" place="margin">For when Chriſt ſhal thus repleniſh his Church by his word and ſpirit, then ſhall ſhe ariſe againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt with fire and ſword, and ſo prevaile.</note> to the final ruine of the Beaſt together with the bond and free Captaines and Kings of the Earth, which ſhall periſh in the damnation of the great Whore, as it is in that 19 Chapt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore beware O yee Kings and Kingdomes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, that there be not found in you the poyſoned cup of the fornications of the Beaſt: for if the eternall Deity do

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.12. <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.33.</note> and the day of glory, to ſinke them downe into eternall Torments, becauſe they regard not his works, nor the operation of his hands, then whom will he ſpare in the day of his fierce wrath, at the finall damnation of this great whore? <hi>And ſo much for what ſhall be her deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet let no man be ſo bold to believe or judge, that all man-kinde which are within the deluded Papacie, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein, that they are all reprobates and certaine to periſh in the damnation of the great whore, for ſome mens mindes, even of them, thirſt after truth as truth; becauſe Antichriſt muſt make ſome ſhew of the ſacred verity in ſome reſpects, even againſt his will, for that as he knowes the ſhew of truth is his helpe, ſo alſo he knowes the practiſe of it in ſimplicity, is his hindrance to his aſpired end. Yet theſe mens hearts in that ſmall light in much confuſion, implicitly deſire Chriſts righteouſneſſe as imputed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who is rich in mercy, will not breake thoſe<note n="(a)" place="margin">Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently by their error in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be againſt Chriſt, as apeareth by his truth in his reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, although for Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their affections ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that dark light ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and here we may admire and cry out, oh the depth of Gods juſtice &amp; mercifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in wiſdom, ſo interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the children of men.</note> bruiſed reeds, nor quench the ſmoaking flax, but even che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſtrengthen their mindes to him, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I heard a voyce from Heaven ſaying, come out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that yee receive not of her Plagues.</hi> Which words imply ſeaven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this voyce from Heaven is ſome out-breake of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Heavenly Doctrine in the purer Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is ſaid, <hi>ſaying unto them,</hi> it implies it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was extended by Gods mercifull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Thirdly, when it calls them to <hi>come out,</hi> it implies, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> were deluded in her fornications, as if they had bin of her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it implies, that this voyce to thoſe people is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Gods laſt warning to <hi>come out from her,</hi> to eſcape the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when it faith, <hi>my people,</hi> it implies, this heavenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> voyce refreſheth their Spirits, as from God graciouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them in their uprightneſſe notwithſtanding their intanglements in the defilements of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, when it is ſaid, <hi>leſt yee be partakers of her ſinnes,</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> implies, that after this out-breake of light, ſhining to them

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seaventhly, when it is ſaid, <hi>leſt you be partakers of her Plagues,</hi> it implies, God will glorifie his juſtice in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of his mercy to them without all reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and to all alike, as is precedently deſcribed.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſo, that Gods grace in Chriſt Jeſus, is both intended and extended univerſally to all, without reſpect of perſons, and to all alike, as here you ſee is proved, then hence obſerve, that thoſe odious Aſperſions that diſgrace this doctrine as falſe and untrue, are unjuſt; as that this doctrine doth uſher in Popery into the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and that it is the doctrine of <hi>Pelagius</hi> or of the <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> meaning, that it is the doctrine of <hi>Arminius,</hi> for this doctrine of univerſall Grace, is Gods, and not mans, and without this ſtreight line of this doctrine, harmoniouſly flowing from ſacred Scriptures, it is impoſſible to raze out the foundation of Popery underſtandingly, to the capacities of mankinde; and the ground of it is this, becauſe the ſacred Scripture in it ſelfe hath no uniforme body, but in this doctrine of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall grace in Chriſt Jeſus to all mankinde, and to all alike, by which Chriſt in the brightneſſe of his coming, and the ſpirit of his mouth will conſume and deſtroy the great Antichriſt and monſter of Chriſtendome, as formerly is proved; wherefore I muſt as the rule of truth bindes me, thus judge of that holy man <hi>Arminius,</hi> that he is not to be reckoned one of the leaſt worthies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe this man in thoſe darke<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>For Mr. <hi>Peter Du. Moulin</hi> chargeth him with holding theſe points, firſt, that God elected ſome men to eternall life upon his foreſight of their faith.

                     <p>Thirdly, that originall ſinne in Infants, hath no reſpect of vice or ſinne properly called, for nothing is ſinne or vice, unleſſe it be committed by free-will. Fourthly, hat <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmeth, that mans will is free to good, as to evill without grace; the which points in this Treatiſe, are clearely proved from Scriptures to be errors. See <hi>Peter Du-moulin</hi> againſt <hi>Arminius Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 48. <hi>&amp; Cap.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp; Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Cap.</hi> 32. <hi>p.</hi> 256.</p>

               <p>And on the contrary, as for reverend <hi>Calvin,</hi> his ſtiffe maintaining that error, which made the waters of life bitter to mankinde, namely, <hi>that God hath perſonally decreed before

               <p>Againe, it eclypſeth the glory of Gods grace and mercy by Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe it referres this internall inclination of the Law written not to Gods univerſall mercy in the gift of the promiſed ſeed, when none but the Image of Satan by his lies was written in mans heart by Satans malice, and mans owne remiſſeneſſe, and by divine Juſtice totally and eternally ſo to remaine.</p>
               <p>And in a word, becauſe this brings man to turne his eyes to looke upon his left, and remaining abilities; ſo that all he hath before faith, is not received from Gods mercy in Chriſt, but from his owne ſtore, and ſo by pride to fall from grace: Therefore this internall diſpoſition was infuſed by Gods univerſall grace in the promiſed ſeed.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>God then purpoſed in himſelfe to glorifie his mercy &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative goodneſſe and juſtice, by the diſtribution of that mercy indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually upon every of mankind:</hi> firſt, <hi>by giving to all and all alike in Chriſt Ieſus, both the meanes and end,</hi> namely, <hi>to eternall glory. I doe not ſay he gave any thing to them to attaine eternall life, but onely as a meanes to receive his gift of eternall life, as attained by Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Adam <hi>and Saviour of the world, and ſo to glorifie his gracious goodneſſe and mercy in their ſalvation.</hi> Or, on the contrary, to glorifie his juſtice on them which abuſe his grace by a proud perſiſting in obſtinacy, for terreſtriall trifles to reject his gift of <hi>Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe the onely ground of mans felicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that God doth thus impartially glorifie his <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> individually upon mankind, is proved in the threefold parts of time, as from <hi>Adams</hi> caſting out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from <hi>Chriſts</hi> comming in the fleſh, to his comming in flames of fire; at the end of time, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.7, 9, 10, 11, 12. And as for any other decree of God then this concerning the eternall ſtate of mankinde, the Scripture ſpeakes it not.</p>
